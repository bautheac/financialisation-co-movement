<p>In the early 2000s institutional investors entered the commodity futures markets en masse with passive, long only, index type positions in sharp contrast with those typically assumed by traditional expert participants. A heated public debate soon erupted over the perceived consequences of the phenomenon–commonly referred to as “financialisation”—and, in response to immediate policy concerns, the matter was thrust onto the academic sphere as a burning issue. With the benefit of hindsight it now seems that the academic debate was framed rather narrowly, used contentious research methods, and eventually led to regulatory changes that were therefore perhaps unwarranted. In contrast, we take a broader approach where we consider a large cross-section of liquid commodities as suggested by the nature of financilisation that comprehends commodity futures as an asset class. Using a bespoke asset pricing factors based framework we study the issue through the lens of co-movement and find that the phenomenon had ontological consequences for the commodity complex with its impact extending beyond the mechanical effects induced by indexation. The onset of the financial crisis and the monetary policy regimes that followed, on the other hand, seem to have set off a motion of reversion to legacy pre-financialisation fundamentals, in other words, a process of “definancialisation” in global commodity futures markets.</p>

<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<!-- Introduction {#introduction} -->
<!-- ========================== -->
<p>The last twenty years have seen major upheavals in the commodity markets with the onset of financialisation<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> as well as the period of the 2008 financial crisis and its aftermath. Financialisation appears to have affected multiple economic sectors, including agriculture and energy, and its impact has been hotly debated in the policy, legislative, regulatory, and academic spheres. A vigorous legislative debate has led to regulatory changes accompanied by an equally intense policy and academic debate across a number of disciplines about the perceived effects on commodity prices of the unprecedented inflow of institutional funds brought into commodity futures markets by new index type investors<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>. In response to immediate policy concerns, the academic debate was initially framed rather narrowly. In this paper we take a fundamentally different empirical approach that is broader in scope. We consider the entire cross-section of actively traded commodities on futures markets and use a futures-based asset pricing framework that includes factors constructed using both theoretical fundamentals and liquidity considerations.<br />
Commodity futures markets have a history of being the classic physical commodity price risk shifting conduit for commodity specialists, and financialisation may have altered this long-standing paradigm with the entry of long only commodity index traders (CITs) with very different hedging and volume demands from traditional participants. This change could have altered the hedging ontology in these markets and our asset pricing framework is well suited to detect these more subtle effects driven by changes in the nature of market participation. Factor model techniques are well suited to isolating common driving factors and detecting co-movement; building on theory we therefore develop a bespoke commodity-based asset pricing framework that seems well adapted to study these two issues simultaneously. It is comprised of factor models based both on fundamentals as well as liquidity considerations. One of these is based on the Keynes-Hicks <span class="citation">(Keynes 1923, 1930; Hicks 1939, 1946)</span> risk transfer approach to the term structure; the corresponding “theory of normal backwardation”, complemented for the possibility of contango <span class="citation">(H. Houthakker 1957; Cootner 1960)</span>, postulates that futures prices for a given commodity are inversely related to the extent that commercial hedgers are short or long and using commercial hedging pressure (CHP) as a proxy for hedgers net market position we construct factor mimicking portfolios that capture the impact of hedging pressure as a systemic factor <span class="citation">(Basu and Miffre 2013)</span>. Working’s contending approach that relates futures price formation to storage costs in the theory of “the price of storage” <span class="citation">(Working 1949)</span> forms the basis of another model that we consider where, following <span class="citation">Szymanowska et al. (2014)</span> and <span class="citation">Fuertes, Miffre, and Fernandez-Perez (2015)</span> who demonstrate that the term structure factor has explanatory power for the cross-section of commodity returns, we construct factor mimicking portfolios using roll-yield as a proxy for the front end shape of individual commodity term structures. We further consider a liquidity-based model following <span class="citation">Hong and Yogo (2012)</span> who find that open interest growth has predictive power for individual commodity returns and again, using the latter measure as a proxy for individual commodity liquidity, we construct long-short factor mimicking portfolios.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We study the performance of these models on a set of twenty-four US traded commodities and six UK traded (London Metal Exchange) base metals over the 1997/2018 period that we divide into four distinct sub-periods: pre-financialisation (1997/2003); financialisation (2004/2008<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>); financial crisis and aftermath, including loose monetary policy regimes that followed (2008/2013); and post-crisis (2014-2018).<br />
Consistent with earlier studies, we observe that mean returns for the US traded commodities are sharply higher over the financialisation period compared to pre-financialisation and this pattern extends to UK traded metals.<br />
The cross-sectional nature of financialisation <span class="citation">(Cheng and Xiong 2014; Basak and Pavlova 2016)</span> leads us to extend the Keynesian individual hedging pressure paradigm by incorporating aggregate CHP (<strong>CHP</strong>), a market wide measure of hedging pressure first considered in <span class="citation">Hong and Yogo (2012)</span>. This paradigm implies that returns for individual commodities should be high in periods where <strong>CHP</strong> is low (<strong>backwardation</strong>) and low in periods where <strong>CHP</strong> is high (<strong>contango</strong>). Over the first period the cross-sectional average returns during phases of <strong>backwardation</strong> for both the US and UK commodities are positive and overall higher than during phases of <strong>contango</strong>, providing broad support for an aggregate version of the Keynesian hedging pressure hypothesis. Over the second period this pattern reverses, with both the US and UK commodities having higher returns during phases of <strong>contango</strong> as opposed to <strong>backwardation</strong>. This change in pattern suggests the onset of financialisation altered the traditional risk shifting nature of hedger’s behaviour, implied by the Keynesian hypothesis.<br />
The arrival of financial investors, on the other hand, raises the question of whether they functioned as liquidity providers or demanders. Arguments have been put forward in favour of both possibilities with <span class="citation">Moskowitz, Ooi, and Pedersen (2012)</span> arguing that financial investors provide liquidity and <span class="citation">Kang, Rouwenhorst, and Tang (2020)</span> taking the opposite stance. Our analysis of returns in periods of low and high <strong>CHP</strong> before and during financialisation allows us to analyse this issue from a new perspective and suggests that financial investors may have been liquidity demanders leading hedgers to become liquidity providers.<br />
<span class="citation">Goldstein, Li, and Yang (2014)</span> and <span class="citation">Goldstein and Yang (2017)</span> argue that the arrival of financial investors had an impact on the extent of normal backwardation in commodity futures markets. Based on their analysis we would expect our average CHP factor, based on backwardation as measured by hedger’s positions (Keynesian perspective, theory of normal backwardation: <span class="citation">Keynes (1930)</span>, <span class="citation">Hicks (1939)</span>, <span class="citation">H. S. Houthakker (1957)</span>, <span class="citation">Telser (1958)</span>), as well our term structure factor, based on backwardation as measured by roll yield (Working’s perspective, theory of storage: <span class="citation">Working (1933)</span>, <span class="citation">Kaldor (1939)</span>, <span class="citation">Working (1948)</span>, <span class="citation">Brennan (1958)</span>, <span class="citation">Cootner (1960)</span>, <span class="citation">Weymar (1966)</span>, <span class="citation">Danthine (1978)</span>, <span class="citation">Turnovsky (1983)</span>, <span class="citation">Schwartz (1997)</span>), to be best suited to measure the impact of financialisation.<br />
We analyse the pricing dynamics over the different periods by first studying the time series explanatory performance of the various factors on all the US traded commodities with the factors constructed using the latter set of commodities. The market-based factor outperforms the other three in the first period and, although its performance increases over the financialisation period, that of the CHP factor shows a greater improvement in a relative sense. The performance of the market factor is driven by agricultural and energy commodities in the first period while metals strongly contribute to the performance improvement observed over the second period. Similarly, the dramatic improvement of the CHP factor in the second period, is driven by the metals complex, particularly that of the long leg where they predominantly load. Average pairwise correlations amongst individual factors’ best performing commodities increase across the board over the financialisation period, far beyond the average for the whole cross-section of US traded commodities. The increase is particularly strong for the long-short factors, in a relative sense, on which the metal complex loads significantly more during financialisation. This increase is due to the dramatic rise in average pairwise correlation amongst the US traded metals all of which exhibited high <span class="math inline">\(R^{2}\)</span> with respect to the CHP factor during financialisation which in turn is due to their common low level of CHP over this period. The CHP factor model thus seems able to establish the strengthening link between a non-price attribute and price dynamics in the US metal sub-sector during financialisation.<br />
We explore this issue further by constructing the four factors independently with the top eight commodities for a given factor (factor picks) in each period<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> and evaluating its performance on these selected commodities as well as on all US traded commodities. The results of this exercise provide evidence of convergence of Keynesian and Working’s theories of the term structure in detecting price co-movement during financialisation and strongly suggest that the term structure related attributes (hedging pressure/roll) co-movement and price co-movement link was concentrated in the metals sub-sector.<br />
The UK traded base metals provide a useful set of assets to test how widespread were the changes in pricing dynamics brought about by the onset of financialisation. To that end, we examine the performance of the four factors on the six UK metals, when constructed from each set of factor picks. The results show that there was co-movement in global metals returns in the second period and that this co-movement could be detected by our term structure related models, particularly so by our hedging pressure-based model.<br />
The onset of the financial crisis and the monetary policy regimes that followed, on the other hand, also appear to have induced significant changes. Commodity futures returns fell dramatically into the crisis and the pricing results indicate the emergence of a systematic factor across the entire cross-section of the US commodities as well as evidence of cross-market linkages with the UK traded commodity subset. The post-crisis results, in contrast, show a substancial pullback in performance for the market factor across the board as well as evidence of decoupling between the US and UK markets. Besides, starting in the crisis the Keneysian paradigm of returns begins to revert with higher mean returns during low (<strong>backwardation</strong>) relative to high (<strong>contango</strong>) <strong>CHP</strong> phases and this pattern continues, more pronounced, over the post-crisis period. As pointed out in <span class="citation">Basu and Bauthéac (2021)</span>, the financial crisis and ensuing accommodative monetary policy therefore seem to have initiated a process of reversion toward pre-financialisation fundamentals in the global commodity futures complex.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Financialisation was an issue of such policy importance that it triggered legislative action. The debate was initially framed around adequacy of speculation, the burning issue of the day, and the ensuing academic analysis focused on the more mechanical effects of financialisation. With the benefit of hindsight, it appears this approach was perhaps too narrow, and it now seems necessary to address the phenomenon from a broader perspective. Commodity price dynamics appear to have altered substantially in quite different ways over the financialisation and the financial crisis periods and our commodity futures asset pricing factors based approach seems able to provide new insights into the nature of these changes: financialisation was a phenomenon endogenous to the commodity markets transmitted via the commodity futures markets and which effects were particularly strong for the metals sector while the crisis and its aftermath seems to have delivered an exogenous shock across the entire cross-section of liquid commodities and thereby potentially triggered a process of “definancialisaion” in global commodity futures markets. The initial view of financialisation was that it consisted of speculative flows which had the effect of driving up and creating bubble like conditions in commodity futures prices<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a>. However, the fundamental question of the nature of the impact of financialisation across the entire cross-section of commodity futures markets has not yet been completely answered. We provide an empirical complement to a new stream of theoretical studies that try to model the impact of financialisation on various aspects of commodity futures markets<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> and demonstrate that the effects of financialisation extend beyond the mechanical effects induced by indexation as outlined in <span class="citation">Tang and Xiong (2012)</span> and <span class="citation">Basak and Pavlova (2016)</span>.</p>
