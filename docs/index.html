<p>In the early 2000s institutional investors entered the commodity futures markets en masse with passive, long only, index type positions in sharp contrast with those typically assumed by traditional expert participants. A heated public debate soon erupted over the perceived consequences of the phenomenon–commonly referred to as “financialisation”—and, in response to immediate policy concerns, the matter was thrust onto the academic sphere as a burning issue. With the benefit of hindsight it now seems that the academic debate was framed rather narrowly, used contentious research methods, and eventually led to regulatory changes that were therefore perhaps unwarranted. In contrast, we take a broader approach where we consider a large cross-section of liquid commodities as suggested by the nature of financilisation that comprehends commodity futures as an asset class. Using a bespoke asset pricing factors based framework we study the issue through the lens of co-movement and find that the phenomenon had ontological consequences for the commodity complex with its impact extending beyond the mechanical effects induced by indexation. The onset of the financial crisis and the monetary policy regimes that followed, on the other hand, seem to have set off a motion of reversion to legacy pre-financialisation fundamentals.</p>

<!-- Introduction {#introduction} -->
<!-- ========================== -->
<p>The last twenty years have seen major upheavals in the commodity markets with the onset of financialisation<a href="references.html#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> as well as the period of the 2008 financial crisis and its aftermath. Financialisation appears to have affected multiple economic sectors, including agriculture and energy, and its impact has been hotly debated in the policy, legislative, regulatory, and academic spheres. A vigorous legislative debate accompanied by an equally intense policy and academic debate across a number of disciplines about the perceived effects on commodity prices of the unprecedented inflow of institutional funds brought into commodity futures markets by new index type investors<a href="references.html#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> eventually led to regulatory changes in several individual markets.<br />
In response to immediate policy concerns, the academic debate was initially framed rather narrowly around adequacy of speculation–the burning issue of the day–at the individual commodity market level and the ensuing academic analysis focused on the more mechanical effects of financialisation. With the benefit of hindsight, this approach seems to lack a fundamental understanding of the phenomenon it endeavoured to study and which consequences it attempted to address.<br />
Financialisation was a phenomenon global in nature; through the channel of index investment it affected the whole cross-section of liquid commodities at once, eventually spurring its transition away from a collection of idiosyncratic markets to its emergence as an asset class. Focusing on individual markets in this context thus seems limited. Most of the studies underpinning the regulatory response to financialisation took the form of pairwise correlation, causation and to some extent co-integration analysis, all of which are idiosyncratic in nature for they study single pairs of individual assets. Besides, some of these techniques since proved controversial and seem to produce results the quality of which may fall short of the standards that may reasonably be expected to lay the ground for legislative action. Although appealing, for it comes with the promise of prompt “significant” results, this approach misses a critical corollary of the substantial advent of a new category of players in a (set of) market(s): the alteration of market fundamentals it potentially induces, best observed in this context through the lens of commercial hedging pressure <span class="citation">(Keynes 1930; Hicks 1939)</span>.<br />
While essential to the understanding of the phenomenon, the global nature of financialisation and its impact on market fundamentals therefore appear to have been originally overlooked and another approach, perhaps more refined, seems warranted.</p>
<p>We strive to provide one in this study by taking a fundamentally different empirical perspective that is broader in scope. We consider the entire cross-section of actively traded commodities on futures markets and use a futures-based asset pricing framework that includes factors constructed using both theoretical fundamentals and liquidity considerations.<br />
The global nature of financialisation makes cross-sectional co-movement a cornerstone issue that the direct impact of increased market participation alone might not be able to fully explain for it potentially had deeper effects, for example on market fundamentals as our results suggest. Commodity futures markets have a history of being the classic physical commodity price risk shifting conduit for commodity specialists. Over the financialisation period we observe a decrease in effectiveness of commercial hedging pressure (CHP) at explaining commodity futures returns at the individual level accompanied by a more pronounced increase at the aggregate level. We further note an overall shift in the nature of hedger’s behaviour away from the traditional Keynesian view of risk transfer with higher individual risk premiums over phases of cross-sectional contango as opposed to backwardation. Both patterns suggest that the phenomenon may have altered this long-standing paradigm of commercial risk transfer with the entry of long only commodity index traders (CITs) with very different hedging and volume demands from traditional participants. This change could have altered the hedging ontology in these markets and our asset pricing framework is well suited to detect these more subtle effects driven by changes in the nature of market participation.<br />
Factor model techniques are well suited to isolating common driving factors and detecting co-movement <span class="citation">(Fama and French 1993, 2015; Carhart 1997; C. Asness and Frazzini 2013; Hou, Xue, and Zhang 2015; C. Asness et al. 2015; Frazzini and Pedersen 2014; C. S. Asness, Frazzini, and Pedersen 2019)</span> at a broader level, beyond individual pairs of assets, and are commonly used to study commodity market fundamentals <span class="citation">(E. Schwartz and Smith 2000; Miffre and Rallis 2007; Gorton, Hayashi, and Rouwenhorst 2012; Cortazar, Kovacevic, and Schwartz 2013; Yang 2013; Daskalaki, Kostakis, and Skiadopoulos 2014; Szymanowska et al. 2014; Fernandez-Perez et al. 2018; Bakshi, Gao, and Rossi 2019; Boons and Prado 2019; Sakkas and Tessaromatis 2020)</span>; they consequently seem well adapted to study these two issues simultaneously. Building on theory we therefore develop a bespoke commodity-based asset pricing framework comprised of factor models based both on fundamentals as well as liquidity considerations.<br />
One of these is based on the Keynes-Hicks <span class="citation">(Keynes 1923, 1930; Hicks 1939, 1946)</span> risk transfer approach to the term structure; the corresponding “theory of normal backwardation”, complemented for the possibility of contango <span class="citation">(H. Houthakker 1957; Cootner 1960)</span>, postulates that futures prices for a given commodity are inversely related to the extent that commercial hedgers are short or long and using commercial hedging pressure (CHP) as a proxy for hedgers net market position we construct factor mimicking portfolios that capture the impact of hedging pressure as a systemic factor <span class="citation">(Basu and Miffre 2013)</span>. The cross-sectional nature of financialisation <span class="citation">(Cheng and Xiong 2014; Basak and Pavlova 2016)</span> further leads us to extend this paradigm by incorporating aggregate CHP (<strong>CHP</strong>), a market wide measure of hedging pressure first considered in <span class="citation">Hong and Yogo (2012)</span>. In this context, returns for individual commodities should be high in periods where <strong>CHP</strong> is low (<strong>backwardation</strong>) and low in periods where <strong>CHP</strong> is high (<strong>contango</strong>). Working’s contending approach that relates futures price formation to storage costs in the theory of “the price of storage” <span class="citation">(Working 1949)</span> forms the basis of another model that we consider where, following <span class="citation">Szymanowska et al. (2014)</span> and <span class="citation">Fuertes, Miffre, and Fernandez-Perez (2015)</span> who demonstrate that the term structure factor has explanatory power for the cross-section of commodity returns, we construct factor mimicking portfolios using roll-yield as a proxy for the front end shape of individual commodity term structures. We further consider a liquidity-based model following <span class="citation">Hong and Yogo (2012)</span> who find that open interest growth has predictive power for individual commodity returns and again, using the latter measure as a proxy for individual commodity liquidity, we construct long-short factor mimicking portfolios.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We study the performance of these models on a set of twenty-four US traded commodities and six UK traded (London Metal Exchange) base metals over the 1997/2018 period that we divide into four distinct sub-periods: pre-financialisation (1997/2003); financialisation (2004/2008<a href="references.html#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>); financial crisis and aftermath, including loose monetary policy regimes that followed (2008/2013); and post-crisis (2014-2018).<br />
Consistent with earlier studies, we observe that mean returns for the US traded commodities are sharply higher over the financialisation period compared to pre-financialisation and this pattern extends to UK traded metals.</p>
<p>Over the first period the cross-sectional average returns during phases of <strong>backwardation</strong> for both the US and UK commodities are positive and overall higher than during phases of <strong>contango</strong>, providing broad support for an aggregate version of the Keynesian hedging pressure hypothesis. Over the second period this pattern reverses, with both the US and UK commodities having higher returns during phases of <strong>contango</strong> as opposed to <strong>backwardation</strong>. This change in pattern suggests the onset of financialisation altered the traditional risk shifting nature of hedger’s behaviour, implied by the Keynesian hypothesis.<br />
This change of paradigm due to the arrival of financial investors, on the other hand, raises the question of whether they functioned as liquidity providers or demanders. Arguments have been put forward in favour of both possibilities with <span class="citation">Moskowitz, Ooi, and Pedersen (2012)</span> arguing that financial investors provide liquidity and <span class="citation">Kang, Rouwenhorst, and Tang (2020)</span> taking the opposite stance. Our analysis of individual commodity returns’ relation with both CHP and <strong>CHP</strong> before and during financialisation sheds new lights on this issue with our results suggesting that financial investors may have been liquidity demanders leading hedgers to become liquidity providers.</p>
<p><span class="citation">Goldstein, Li, and Yang (2014)</span> and <span class="citation">Goldstein and Yang (2017)</span> argue that the arrival of financial investors had an impact on the extent of normal backwardation in commodity futures markets. Based on their analysis we would expect our average CHP factor, based on backwardation as measured by hedger’s positions (Keynesian perspective, theory of normal backwardation: <span class="citation">Keynes (1930)</span>, <span class="citation">Hicks (1939)</span>, <span class="citation">H. S. Houthakker (1957)</span>, <span class="citation">Telser (1958)</span>), as well our term structure factor, based on backwardation as measured by roll yield (Working’s perspective, theory of storage: <span class="citation">Working (1933)</span>, <span class="citation">Kaldor (1939)</span>, <span class="citation">Working (1948)</span>, <span class="citation">Brennan (1958)</span>, <span class="citation">Cootner (1960)</span>, <span class="citation">Weymar (1966)</span>, <span class="citation">Danthine (1978)</span>, <span class="citation">Turnovsky (1983)</span>, <span class="citation">E. S. Schwartz (1997)</span>), to be best suited to measure the impact of financialisation.<br />
We analyse the pricing dynamics over the different periods by first studying the time series explanatory performance of the various factors on all the US traded commodities with the factors constructed using the latter set of commodities. The market-based factor outperforms the other three in the first period and, although its performance increases over the financialisation period, that of the CHP factor shows a greater improvement in a relative sense. The performance of the market factor is driven by agricultural and energy commodities in the first period while metals strongly contribute to the performance improvement observed over the second period. Similarly, the dramatic improvement of the CHP factor in the second period, is driven by the metals complex, particularly that of the long leg where they predominantly load. Average pairwise correlations amongst individual factors’ best performing commodities increase across the board over the financialisation period, far beyond the average for the whole cross-section of US traded commodities. The increase is particularly strong for the long-short factors, in a relative sense, on which the metal complex loads significantly more during financialisation. This increase is due to the dramatic rise in average pairwise correlation amongst the US traded metals all of which exhibited high <span class="math inline">\(R^{2}\)</span> with respect to the CHP factor during financialisation which in turn is due to their common low level of CHP over this period. The CHP factor model thus seems able to establish the strengthening link between a non-price attribute and price dynamics in the US metal sub-sector during financialisation.<br />
We explore this issue further by constructing the four factors independently with the top eight commodities for a given factor (factor picks) in each period<a href="references.html#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> and evaluating its performance on these selected commodities as well as on all US traded commodities. The results of this exercise provide evidence of convergence of Keynesian and Working’s theories of the term structure in detecting price co-movement during financialisation and strongly suggest that the term structure related attributes (hedging pressure/roll) co-movement and price co-movement link was concentrated in the metals sub-sector.</p>
<p>The UK traded base metals provide a useful set of assets to test how widespread were the changes in pricing dynamics brought about by the onset of financialisation. To that end, we examine the performance of the four factors on the six UK metals, when constructed from each set of factor picks. The results show that there was co-movement in global metals returns in the second period and that this co-movement could be detected by our term structure related models, particularly so by our hedging pressure-based model.</p>
<p>The onset of the financial crisis and the monetary policy regimes that followed, on the other hand, also appear to have induced significant changes. Commodity futures returns fell dramatically into the crisis and the pricing results indicate the emergence of a systematic factor across the entire cross-section of the US commodities as well as evidence of cross-market linkages with the UK traded commodity subset. The post-crisis results, in contrast, show a substancial pullback in performance for the market factor across the board as well as evidence of decoupling between the US and UK markets. Besides, starting in the crisis the Keneysian paradigm of returns begins to revert with higher mean returns during low (<strong>backwardation</strong>) relative to high (<strong>contango</strong>) <strong>CHP</strong> phases and this pattern continues, more pronounced, over the post-crisis period. As pointed out in <span class="citation">Basu and Bauthéac (2021)</span>, the financial crisis and ensuing accommodative monetary policy therefore seem to have initiated a process of reversion toward pre-financialisation fundamentals in the global commodity futures complex.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Financialisation was an issue of such policy importance that it triggered legislative action. The debate was initially framed around adequacy of speculation, the burning issue of the day, and the ensuing academic analysis focused on the more mechanical effects of financialisation.<br />
With the benefit of hindsight, it appears this approach was perhaps too narrow, and it now seems necessary to address the phenomenon from a broader perspective. Commodity price dynamics appear to have altered substantially in quite different ways over the financialisation and the financial crisis periods and our commodity futures asset pricing factors based approach seems able to provide new insights into the nature of these changes: financialisation was a phenomenon endogenous to the commodity markets transmitted via the commodity futures markets and which effects were particularly strong for the metals sector while the crisis and its aftermath seems to have delivered an exogenous shock across the entire cross-section of liquid commodities and thereby potentially triggering a reversion to pre-financialisation dynamics.</p>
<p>The initial view of financialisation was that it consisted of speculative flows which had the effect of driving up and creating bubble like conditions in commodity futures prices<a href="references.html#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a>. However, the fundamental question of the nature of the impact of financialisation across the entire cross-section of commodity futures markets has not yet been completely answered. We provide an empirical complement to a new stream of theoretical studies that try to model the impact of financialisation on various aspects of commodity futures markets<a href="references.html#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> and demonstrate that the effects of financialisation extend beyond the mechanical effects induced by indexation as outlined in <span class="citation">Tang and Xiong (2012)</span> and <span class="citation">Basak and Pavlova (2016)</span>.</p>
