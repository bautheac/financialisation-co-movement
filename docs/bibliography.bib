  abstract = {Preface :  The temperature of the rhetoric in the  food-versus-fuel debate has been rising right along with  the prices of corn and oil. Farm Foundation is not about  heat or fueling fires. Our mission is to be a catalyst for  sound public policy by providing objective information to  foster deeper understanding of the complex issues before  the food system today. We commissioned this paper to  provide a comprehensive, objective assessment of the forces  driving food prices. In recent months, much has been  written in the academic and popular press about commodity  prices, biofuels and food prices—often with varying  perspectives and conclusions. Farm Foundation asked Wallace  Tyner, Philip Abbot and Christopher Hurt, all of Purdue  University, to review the literature and provide a  comprehensive assessment of the forces driving food prices  today. The three economists reviewed more than two dozen  reports and studies, summarizing them in light of their own  examination of the facts. As is true of many issues in the  food system, the full story behind rapid increases in food  prices is not a simple one. Today’s food price levels are  the result of complex interactions among multiple  factors—including crude oil prices, exchange rates,  growing demand for food and slowing growth in agricultural  productivity—as well as the agricultural, energy and  trade policy choices made by nations of the world. But one  simple fact stands out: economic growth and rising human  aspirations are putting ever greater pressure on the global  resource base. The difficult challenge for public and  private leaders is to identify policy choices that help the  world deal with the very real problems created by today’s  rising food prices without jeopardizing aspirations for the  future. It is the intent of Farm Foundation that the  objective information provided in this report will help all  stakeholders meet the challenge to address one of the most  critical public policy issues facing the world today.},

  abstract   = {Motivated by the literature on limits-to-arbitrage, we build an equilibrium model of commodity markets in which speculators are capital constrained, and commodity producers have hedging demands for commodity futures. Increases (decreases) in producers' hedging demand (speculators' risk-capacity) increase hedging costs via price-pressure on futures, reduce producers' inventory holdings, and thus spot prices. Consistent with our model, producers' default risk forecasts futures returns, spot prices, and inventories in oil and gas market data from 1980-2006, and the component of the commodity futures risk premium associated with producer hedging demand rises when speculative activity reduces. We conclude that limits to financial arbitrage generate limits to hedging by producers, and affect both asset and goods prices.}

Positive oil price shocks cause a depreciation of the U.S. dollar against a broad range of currencies but have only a modest effect on bond futures returns.

To correct this, I assume that harvests appear continuously rather than at a single moment. This addition to the standard model allows me to link preharvest and postharvest markets to the same source of supply, and hence obtain the empirically observed high correlation. Empirical evidence also suggests that my assumptions are realistic. Results are robust to different parameter specifications.},

The standard method uses lagged book data to calculate book-to-price (B/P) at portfolio formation. It aligns price data using the same lag, ignoring recent price movements. The authors propose two simple alternatives that use more timely price data; they then construct portfolios based on the different measures for a U.S. sample (from 1950 to 2011) and a global sample (from 1983 to 2011). They show that B/P ratios based on more timely prices better forecast true, unobservable B/P ratios at fiscal year-end. Value portfolios based on the timeliest measures earn statistically significant alphas, ranging between 305 and 378 basis points per year, versus the standard methods.TOPICS: Portfolio construction, statistical methods, accounting and ratio analysis},

When financial innovation allows households to trade in futures markets, they choose a long position that leads to lower equilibrium excess returns on futures, a more frequently upward-sloping futures curve, and higher volatility in futures and spot markets. The effect on spot price levels is modest, and extremely high spot prices only occur in conjunction with low inventories and poor productivity. Therefore such "financialization'' of commodities may explain several recently observed changes in spot and futures market dynamics, but it cannot directly account for a large increase in spot prices.},

When calibrated to data from the crude oil market, the model implies that financialization reduces the futures risk premium and increases correlation between futures open interest and the spot price level. However, there is no long-run increase in the mean spot price, and speculative storage generally attenuates financialization’s effect on spot price volatility. Therefore, financialization’s effect on spot price dynamics through storage arbitrage is likely modest, even if futures positions and risk premia are substantially altered.This paper was accepted by Gustavo Manso, finance. }

Though the impact of trade war could be visibly assessed from declining export volume and rising bankruptcy filing from farmers, what went unnoticed was a far-reaching negative impact at a granular market microstructure level. In this study, the effect of trade war on the leading role of US soybean futures in price discovery has been evaluated. The results corroborate the negative impact of trade war on the information leadership share of US soybean futures market. Moreover, the results shows that the negative impact gets manifested through various sentiment indicators such as Google search trends, hedger's sentiment, and so on. Hence, trade war may have given some temporary economic and strategic benefit to the United States, but it is no less than the proverbial double-edged sword as it nearly killed the soybean market of the United States.},

Further, the relation is asymmetric; the impact of positive unexpected volume shocks on volatility is larger than the impact of negative shocks. Finally, consistent with theories of market depth, the study shows large open interest mitigates volatility.}

The value of a futures contract is zero at the start of each day. The expected change in the futures price satisfies a formula like the capital asset pricing model. If changes in the futures price are independent of the return on the market, the futures price is the expected spot price. The futures market is not unique in its ability to shift risk, since corporations can do that too. The futures market is unique in the guidance it provides for producers, distributors, and users of commodities. Using assumptions like those used in deriving the original option formula, we find formulas for the values of forward contracts and commodity options in terms of the futures price and other variables."}

Using the speculation ratio as a daily measure for long–short speculation, we employ generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity regressions to study its impact on return dynamics. Our results for the Chicago Mercantile Exchange feeder cattle futures market suggest that futures returns are predominantly explained by fundamentals, but their volatility is significantly driven by the speculation ratio. This relationship holds for periods of high- and low-speculative activity alike.},

We find that increased speculation, rather than hedging activity, in commodity derivatives is a key determinant of price discovery in the options markets.},

This paper contains an overview of some of the developments in the formulation of ARCH models and a survey of the numerous empirical applications using financial data.

On the basis of 10 US commodity futures and by capturing the dynamics of the futures volatility terms structure with three factors, we show that in most markets the slope factor is strongly negative in certain periods and at best only weakly negative in other periods. High inventory levels are found to correspond to flatter volatility term structures in seven futures. This finding is consistent with the linkage between carry arbitrage and the Samuelson hypothesis. We also find that a flatter volatility term structure corresponds to lower absolute futures term premiums.},

In addition, tests ignoring cross-sectional dependence can be well-specified and have higher power than tests which account for potential dependence.}

Over the period from 1962 to 1997 there has been a noticeable increase in firm-level volatility relative to market volatility. Accordingly, correlations among individual stocks and the explanatory power of the market model for a typical stock have declined, whereas the number of stocks needed to achieve a given level of diversification has increased.

We establish a theoretical link between growth options available to managers and the idiosyncratic risk of equity. Empirically both the level and variance of corporate growth options are significantly related to idiosyncratic volatility. Accounting for growth options eliminates or reverses the trend in aggregate firm-specific risk. These results are robust for different measures of idiosyncratic volatility, different growth option proxies, across exchanges, and through time. Finally, our results suggest that growth options explain the trend in idiosyncratic volatility beyond alternative explanations.}},

The IVol response to a release depends on agricultural market experts' disagreement and sentiment before the USDA report, and on the extent to which the USDA information surprises the market. Whereas commodity IVols are generally positively related to financial-market sentiment and macroeconomic uncertainty (jointly captured by the volatility index [VIX]), this comovement breaks down on report days—with the VIX and commodity IVols moving in opposite directions.},

Production of the consumption good requires drawing from oil reserves at a fixed rate. Investment necessary to replenish oil reserves is costly and irreversible. We solve for the optimal consumption, production and oil reserves policy for a representative agent. We analyze the equilibrium price of oil, as well as the term structure of oil futures prices. Because investment in oil reserves is irreversible and costly, the optimal investment in new oil reserves is periodic and lumpy. Investment occurs when the crude oil is relatively scarce in the economy. This generates an equilibrium oil price process that has distinct behavior across two regions (characterized by the abundance/scarcity of oil). We undertake three empirical tests suggested by our model. First, we estimate key parameters using SMM to match moments of oil price futures as well as other macroeconomic properties of the data. Second, we estimate an affine regime switching model of the oil price, which captures the main features of our equilibrium model and preserves the tractability of reduced-form models. Lastly, we compare the risk premium in short-maturity oil futures implied by our model to the data.},

In contrast to existing evidence, we find that stock splits in aggregate are followed by positive abnormal future earnings growth, suggesting that stock splits contain information about future, rather than past, operating performance. When we use changes in breadth of institutional ownership as a new metric of information content to corroborate our findings, we find that splits with the greatest increase in breadth experience positive post-split abnormal returns and positive abnormal earnings growth. Together, our results suggest that some splits contain positive information about future performance, and that sophisticated market participants such as institutional investors are able to select these splits.},

These studies measure temperature shocks using the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration definitions of heating degree day (HDD) and cooling degree day (CDD). We show how hourly temperatures can be used to better measure how long as well as how much temperatures depart above and/or below the “comfort level” within a day, the effects of temperature variability within a day, and the effects of thermal inertia. Hourly temperatures also allow us to construct measures of extreme temperatures that better match the timing of release of other market information. Another innovation is that we use more economically relevant weights to convert regional temperature shocks to national averages, and measure expected values of variables via econometric models instead of historical averages. Our results show that the proposed measures of HDD and CDD and temperature changes are important for explaining weekly changes in NG in storage and daily changes in NG futures prices and their variance.},

This ``convective risk flow'' induced by the greater distress of financial institutions led to a change in the allocation of risk with hedgers holding more risk than they did previously.

The methodology can be used with any pair of commodity and asset pricing models. An implementation of the methodology is presented using the Schwartz and Smith (2000) two-factor commodity price model and the CAPM. Reasonable expected spot prices are obtained without negative consequences in the model's fit to futures prices.},

  abstract  = {This research examines and interprets the security market response around annual report release dates. Annual reports contain data beyond that reported in preliminary earnings announcements. While prior research has concentrated on the price response to annual report releases and the issue of information content with mixed results, this paper extends earlier work by employing both price and trading measures. The trading measures, which include number of transactions, size-stratified transactions, and mean transaction size, enable the analysis to address not only information content issues, but also social welfare issues in the sense of Lev and Ohlson (1982) and to coarsely identify what type of investor responds to the annual report by trading. Inferences as to the relative usefulness of annual reports to different investor groups are also made based on these trading measures. A number of studies address, often indirectly, annual report informativeness by examining the price response accompanying the report's release. Of these, studies by Wilson (1987) and Lobo and Song (1989) suggest a price response to the earlier of the annual report or 10-K. However, other studies, including Foster et al. (1986), Mynatt (1988), and Bernard and Stober (1989), fail to detect such a price response. The informativeness of annual reports from a price-based perspective remains an open question and from a trading-based perspective it is an unaddressed question. In this study, price response to the annual report is measured using both absolute value and squared unexpected returns. A market model approach is used to estimate unexpected returns. A simulation analysis is included to substantiate the ability of these two metrics to detect a price response. Unexpected volume and unexpected number of transactions, both in general and for size-stratified trading, are estimated via market model regressions. Unexpected mean transaction sizes are estimated from a temporal drift regression. No evidence of a price response and little evidence of a volume of shares response at annual report dates is found. Number of transactions, however, increases significantly around annual reports, peaking four to five trading days after the annual report release date. This trading response suggests that investors find annual reports informative. The simultaneous absence of an economically significant price response is interpreted as indicating that annual reports provide social welfare value in the sense proposed by Lev and Ohlson (1982). Most notably, the analysis of trading response stratified by transaction size suggests that the trading response occurs mostly within the smallest size strata (i.e., 100 and 200 share transactions, transactions of less than $30,000 in value). Consistent with this, mean transaction sizes during the annual report period are less than expected. This is contrary to mean transaction size behavior at earnings announcement dates (Cready 1988) and suggests that annual reports are of greater value to less wealthy individual investors relative to wealtheir individual and institutional investors. Such a finding is consistent with Hakansson (1977) in that it suggests that "small" investors rely on the public information system (i.e., the annual report) while "large" investors rely more on predisclosure information in making investment decisions.}

A central feature of the model is the explicit recognition of the fact that it is impossible for the market as a whole to carry negative inventories, and this introduces an essential non-linearity which carries through into non-linearity of the predicted commodity price series. For most of the thirteen commodity prices, the behaviour of prices from one year to the next conforms to the predictions of the theory about conditional expectations and conditional variances. However, given the non-linearity both of the model and of the actual prices, such conformity is not enough to ensure that the theory yields a complete account of the data. In particular, the analysis does not yield a fully satisfactory explanation for the high autocorrelation observed in the data.}},

  abstract  = {DeMarco's "Structured Analysis and System Specification" is the final paper chosen for inclusion in this book of classic articles on the structured revolution. It is last of three on the subject of analysis, and, together with Ross/Schoman [Paper 22] and Teichroew/Hershey [Paper 23], provides a good idea of the direction that structured analysis will be taking in the next few years.Any competent systems analyst undoubtedly could produce a five-page essay on "What's Wrong with Conventional Analysis." DeMarco, being an ex-analyst, does so with pithy remarks, describing conventional analysis as follows""Instead of a meaningful interaction between analyst and user, there is often a period of fencing followed by the two parties' studiously ignoring each other... The cost-benefit study is performed backwards by deriving the development budget as a function of expected savings. (Expected savings were calculated by prorating cost reduction targets handed down from On High.)"In addition to providing refreshing prose, DeMarco's approach differs somewhat --- in terms of emphasis --- from that of Teichroew/Hershey and of Ross/Schoman. Unlike his colleagues, DeMarco stresses the importance of the maintainability of the specification. Take, for instance, the case of one system consisting of six million lines of COBOL and written over a period of ten years by employees no longer with the organization. Today, nobody knows what the system does.t Not only have the program listings and source code been lost --- a relatively minor disaster that we all have seen too often --- but the specifications are completely out of date. Moreover, the system has grown so large that neither the users nor the data processing people have the faintest idea of what the system is supposed to be doing, let alone how the mysterious job is being accomplished! The example is far from hypothetical, for this is the fate that all large systems eventually will suffer, unless steps are taken to keep the specifications both current and understandable across generations of users.The approach that DeMarco suggests --- an approach generally known today as structured analysis --- is similar in form to that proposed by Ross and Schoman, and emphasizes a top-down, partitioned, graphic model of the system-to-be. However, in contrast to Ross and Schoman, DeMarco also stresses the important role of a data dictionary and the role of scaled-down specifications, or minispecs, to be written in a rigorous subset of the English language known as Structured English.DeMarco also explains carefully how the analyst proceeds lrom a physical description of the user's current system, through a logical description of that same system, and eventually into a logical description of the new system that the user wants. Interestingly, DeMarco uses top-down, partitioned dataflow diagrams to illustrate this part of the so-called Project Life Cycle --- thus confirming that such a graphic model can be used to portray virtually any system.As in other short papers on the subject, the details necessary for carrying out DeMarco's approach are missing or are dealt with in a superficial manner. Fortunately, the details can be found: Listed at the end of the paper are references to three full-length books and one videotape training course, all dealing with the kind of analysis approach recommended by DeMarco.},

We show that managers respond to the shareholder pressure by reporting positive corporate news before the annual shareholder meetings. Specifically, we find significantly positive average cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) during the 40 days before the annual meeting date. The premeeting returns are significantly higher when shareholder discontent with managerial performance is likely to be stronger. The decile of companies with the worst past stock price performance exhibits average CARs of 3.4\% and buy-and-hold returns of 7.0\% during the 40-day premeeting period. Companies with poor past performance exhibit even higher premeeting returns when shareholder pressure on management is greater, such as when institutional ownership is high, when CEO compensation is high, and when shareholders submit proxy proposals on corporate governance. We complement the evidence based on CARs by showing how managers of poorly performing firms manage the timing and content of earnings announcements and management forecast announcements before the annual shareholder meetings. Overall, the results suggest that managers attempt to influence shareholders before annual shareholder meetings through positive news.},

The results document that pure placing firms have high earnings quality and abnormally high growth opportunities at the announcement. For this reason, the market is overenthusiastic. It expects more than what is eventually fulfilled, in line with the over-reaction hypothesis. Weak evidence that placing firms may exploit market timing is noted, whilst there is no supportive evidence of earnings management. These findings distinguish the earnings quality and growth opportunities of pure placing firms from that of firms conducting open offers, firm commitment offers and other seasoned equity offerings (SEO) that are not private placements, for which prior evidence reports mainly timing and/or earnings management prior to the event.

Using hand-collected data from oil and gas producers, we find that these firms hedge oil prices during periods of financial distress. Derivative portfolios in these firms are characterized by short put options. These positions are part of a composite three-way (3W) collar strategy that combines buying put options and selling put and call options with differing strike prices. Because liquidity demand varies with the degree of financial distress, the 3W collar strategy preserves incentives for future growth.},

Suppose two investors prefer to speculate with each other, under the common knowledge that they are motivated to trade purely by a difference in beliefs (unconditional probability assessments). In the absence of third-party costs, are there conditions under which society should try to prevent them from doing so? The second challenge is the existence of a rationale for a policy based on beliefs, as distinct from other determinants of risk preferences. The third challenge is the ability of enforcement agencies to monitor the distinction between belief-motivated trade and trade motivated by more obvious welfare-enhancing activities, such as hedging, liquidity provision, or acquiring payoff-relevant information.}

The results are applied to testing the serial independence of the disturbances in a regression model where some of the regressors are lagged dependent variables. It is shown that the asymptotic distribution of the lag-1 serial correlation coefficient calculated from the least-squares residuals differs from that of the coefficient calculated from the true disturbances. A consequence of this is that tests of serial independence based on the residuals from regression on fixed regressors are invalid when applied to models containing lagged dependent variables even when the null hypothesis of serial independence is true. Tests which are asymptotically valid for the large-sample case are suggested.}

  abstract  = {Traditional econometric models assume a constant one-period forecast variance. To generalize this implausible assumption, a new class of stochastic processes called autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic (ARCH) processes are introduced in this paper. These are mean zero, serially uncorrelated processes with nonconstant variances conditional on the past, but constant unconditional variances. For such processes, the recent past gives information about the one-period forecast variance. A regression model is then introduced with disturbances following an ARCH process. Maximum likelihood estimators are described and a simple scoring iteration formulated. Ordinary least squares maintains its optimality properties in this set-up, but maximum likelihood is more efficient. The relative efficiency is calculated and can be infinite. To test whether the disturbances follow an ARCH process, the Lagrange multiplier procedure is employed. The test is based simply on the autocorrelation of the squared OLS residuals. This model is used to estimate the means and variances of inflation in the U.K. The ARCH effect is found to be significant and the estimated variances increase substantially during the chaotic seventies.}

For Japan, the relation between average returns and B/M is strong, but average returns show little relation to profitability or investment. A five-factor model that adds profitability and investment factors to the three-factor model of Fama and French (1993) largely absorbs the patterns in average returns. As in Fama and French, 2015, Fama and French, 2016, the model's prime problem is failure to capture fully the low average returns of small stocks whose returns behave like those of low profitability firms that invest aggressively.},

Furthermore, open interest, currency, and inflation premia are sensitive to institutional settings. The observed premia cannot be attributed to common risks, sentiment, transactions costs, or data-snooping, but are related to liquidity, anchoring, and regulation-induced limits-to-arbitrage.

Commodities with lower (higher) sentiment shifts tend to be overvalued (undervalued) when the aggregate market is in backwardation (contango). The sentiment premium is more pronounced during periods of macro contraction and deteriorating funding liquidity. While the premium concentrates in commodities with higher tweet intensity, sentiment extracted from influential tweets (i.e., high number of retweets/likes) does not exhibit stronger predictive ability than low-attention tweets.

This interpretation has been driving policy efforts to tighten the regulation of oil derivatives markets. This survey reviews the evidence supporting this view. We identify six strands in the literature and discuss to what extent each sheds light on the role of speculation. We find that the existing evidence is not supportive of an important role of speculation in driving the spot price of oil after 2003. Instead, there is strong evidence that the co-movement between spot and futures prices reflects common economic fundamentals rather than the financialization of oil futures markets.}

Our results suggest that the convenience yield, the global economic activity index, and the government bond yields act as the main factors that exercise a persistent and significant impact, for the largest part of the study period, although at different magnitude. More importantly, though, we show that at different time periods there are additional factors that exercise a significant impact on the oil price differential, such as refining constraints, stock market volatility, trading volume, and geopolitical risk. Thus, unless a dynamic modeling framework is employed, the full spectrum of the related effects cannot be revealed. A series of tests confirm the robustness of our findings.

More recent research suggests that a subsequent era of de-financialization has coincided with the retreat of institutional investors. This paper uses a latent factor model to examine the dynamic impact of commodity market financialization on spot currency, commodity and equity market linkages, focusing on countries with ‘commodity currencies’. The financialization period is characterized by increased interdependence of non-oil and oil commodity markets with each other and with other asset markets, implying reduced diversification potential. We find that commodity markets have become more highly interconnected with currency and equity markets of the large commodity exporters over the most recent sub-sample. We suggest that apparent de-financialization may be attributable to contagion effects from global crisis events, including the Great Recession and the European Debt Crisis of 2012.}

A trading strategy that buys futures with positive RNSK and sells futures with negative RNSK generates a significant excess return. Unlike traditional commodity risk factors' signals, the positive return generated from the RNSK signal is more pronounced in the contango phase. After controlling traditional commodity risk factors, the RNSK signal exhibits a more stable and prolonged predictive ability. The directional-learning hypothesis explains the RNSK impact when commodity futures show higher idiosyncratic risks and illiquidity (positive RNSK) and overpriced (negative RNSK).},

  abstract  = {Although the investigation of the effects of corporate events on stock prices is a well- established line of research in accounting and finance, only a limited attention has been devoted to one of the most important corporate events: the Annual General Meeting (AGM). The current empirical evidence is not only scarce, but is also limited to the US and the UK, countries whose legal tradition is based on the common law. In these countries the AGM has been found to involve the release of relevant information to the market. Nevertheless, since the influential paper by La Porta et al. (1998), evidence reported in common law countries cannot be automatically extrapolated to countries with a different legal tradition. In this paper, we have investigated the effects of AGM on stock returns, volatility and trading volumes, in the Spanish stock market. As expected, our results indicate that the information content of the AGM is lower in Spain than in common law countries. In fact, the AGM does not have any significant effect in any of the three indicators. After examining possible explanations, we conclude that no relevant information seems to be released to the market during AGM, thus having zero impact on returns, volatility and trading volumes. Nevertheless, the behaviour of cumulative returns and trading volumes suggests that market participants expect the release of relevant information during these meetings.}

In fact, no relevant information is released during the AGM in the Spanish stock market. This result is robust to company characteristics like size and the level of insider shareholders within its capital. Our findings support that the AGM plays a less significant role in ensuring good corporate governance in civil-law compared with common-law countries.},

After the break in 2010, the paper market activity, open interest, and shipping costs have become more important spread drivers.},

Coordination among speculators is sometimes desirable for price informativeness and investment efficiency, but speculators' incentives push in the opposite direction, so that they coordinate exactly when it is undesirable.

Empirical results show the significant pure contagion effects between energy and industrial metals markets in most periods, while pure contagion effects between energy and precious metals and agricultural markets occur only in a few specific periods. Comparing the level of pure contagion effects between different commodity markets, energy is still the main price transmitter. In addition, with the acceleration of the global commodity market financialization process, the frequency and harm of pure contagion effects are gradually increasing. Notably, the COVID-19 pandemic is emerging as another major crisis after the global financial crisis, exacerbating the pure contagion effects between energy and precious metals and agricultural markets.},

  abstract = {The U.S. defense industry provides a natural experiment for examining how changes in growth opportunities affect the level and structure of corporate debt. The growth opportunities of defense firms, compared with other firms, increased substantially during the Reagan defense buildup of the early 1980s but then declined significantly with the end of the cold war and associated defense budget cuts in the late 1980s and early 1990s. We examine how the level and structure of corporate debt changed for a sample of 61 defense firms and a benchmark sample of 61 manufacturing firms during 1980–95, a period spanning the changes in growth opportunities. The debt levels of weapons manufacturers, which were most affected by the changes in growth opportunities, increased significantly as their growth opportunities declined. In addition, these firms lengthened the maturity structure of their debt, decreased the ratio of private to public debt, and decreased the use of senior debt as their growth opportunities declined. The results complement other studies that have found cross-sectional relations between proxies for growth opportunities and leverage variables and validate the prominent role played by growth opportunities in the theory of corporate finance.},

The empirical evidence suggests that a U.S. monetary contraction leads to an immediate rise in the broad commodity price index, which possibly reflects an aggregation bias, greater expected inflation and speculation, high production costs or some overshooting due to overreactions. Then, the response erodes after six quarters as the positive interest rate shock vanishes and higher interest rates and liquidity drainage take traction. Despite this, the aggregate price response masks the existence of significant heterogeneity in the price responses of the different types of commodity sectors. More specifically, a positive interest rate shock leads to: (i) an initial pop in the price returns of the non-fuel commodities, which later reverses path and becomes negative (as in the case of the prices of agricultural raw materials); (ii) a positive and persistent rise in the volatile food prices; (iii) a fall in the beverage prices; and (iv) a persistent reduction in the prices of metals and the prices of energy prices. Our results also remain globally intact with respect to alternative specifications and identification schemes as well as to unconventional monetary policy effects. Similar results are also found when commodity futures prices are used. We conclude that policymakers should recognize the source of sector inflation before embarking on contractionary monetary policy. The design of core inflation targeting is also preferable to headline inflation targeting.},

The trend factor generates statistically and economically large returns during the post-financialization period 2004–2020. It outperforms the well-known momentum factor by more than nine times the Sharpe ratio and has less downside risk. The trend factor cannot be explained by the existing factor models and is priced cross-sectionally. Finally, we find that the trend factor is correlated with funding liquidity measured by the TED spread. Overall, the results indicate that there are significant economic gains from using the information on historical prices in commodity futures markets.},

The flows are not based on information about futures price movements but nonetheless cause increases and decreases in commodity futures prices when they are passed through to and withdrawn from the futures markets. These finding are consistent with the hypothesis that non-information-based financial investments have important impacts on commodity prices.}

Based upon the model developed in Part 1 of this paper, the statistical framework is derived for both parametric and nonparametric tests of market-timing ability. If the manager's forecasts are observable, then the nonparametric test can be used without further assumptions about the distribution of security returns. If the manager's forecasts are not observable, then the parametric test can be used under the assumption of either a capital asset pricing model or a multifactor return structure. The tests differ from earlier work because they permit identification and separation of the gains of market-timing skills from the gains of micro stock-selection skills.}

Owing to supply shocks that stochastically redistribute real wealth (surplus) between producers and consumers, and to limited participation in the futures market, the total risk premium in the model is not proportional to the contract's covariance with aggregate consumption. Stock market variability interacts with the incentive to hedge, causing the producer hedging component of the risk premium to increase (decrease) with income elasticity, for a normal (inferior) good. Production costs that depend on output raise the premium. We argue that output and demand shocks will typically be positively correlated, raising the premium. High supply elasticity reduces the absolute heding premium by reducing the variability of spot price and revenue.}

Positive (negative) complementarity in consumer preferences promotes downward (upward) bias in the futures price viewed as a predictor of the later spot price. I demonstrate that the conclusion derived from partial equilibrium analysis--that when speculators are risk averse, risk premia are a function of hedging pressure--fails in the general equilibrium analysis, so long as there are no transaction costs. A counterexample is analyzed in which, as consumers' additive logarithmic preferences are varied, producers' hedging positions change from long to short, while the futures risk premium remains unchanged. However, hedging pressure is reinstated as a force influencing risk premia in the sense that the futures price is downward biased when hedgers take short positions and is upward biased when hedgers take long positions, provided it can be assumed (as is usually valid) that fixed setup costs of trading deter consumers more than producers from participating in the futures market.}

For a commodity that is subject to output shocks, processors tend to hedge long, in contrast with Hick's theory of futures hedging. Nevertheless, if transaction costs are low, the two-stage production process brings about a downward futures price bias, consistent with Hick's pricing prediction. But if costs of trading futures are high, growers tend to be differentially driven from the futures market, reversing the direction of the bias. Futures trading may also affect the organization of industry; when demand is inelastic, futures trading can serve as a substitute for vertical integration as a means of diversifying risk because the risk positions of growers are complementary with those of processors.}

The structural change indicates that financialization creates a role for adverse liquidity shocks to increase cross-market correlations. Further evidence shows that the effect of liquidity on cross-market correlations is state-dependent and intensifies when liquidity conditions deteriorate and asset returns sustain substantial declines. Our findings are not explained by business cycles.},

Quantile-on-quantile regression results show that the dependency structures of most spot and futures prices exhibit an almost similar shape with positive coefficients, which indicates that most futures products are good hedges and safe havens for the corresponding spot prices. Quantile hedge ratios vary with the quantiles, displaying a U-shape, so the hedge ratios of most commodities should increase moderately in both bearish and bullish markets. As for portfolio performance, metal commodities perform best; agricultural commodities second best, and energy commodities relatively poorly. Out-of-sample quantile hedging results are consistent with in-sample results. Therefore, participating in the futures market can effectively manage risk. The premise is that investors pay attention to market dynamics and adjust their portfolios promptly.},

We find little evidence that limits events are the result of speculative activity, but instead associated with shocks to fundamentals that lead to persistent price changes. When futures trading halts price discovery migrates to options markets, but option prices provide a biased estimate of subsequent future prices when trading resumes.},

The specific setting for this study, a ladies tea club, is also novel as a locale for accounting research more generally. In this regard, the article attempts to advance an appreciation of the role of accounting in everyday life. The investigation involves a review of the minutes of the AGM of the Edinburgh University Tea Club for a period of 25 years from the time of its establishment in 1920. Such a review reveals a rich social history of the club's operations and provides a context for a more complete understanding of accounting's role in organizational and social functioning. }

We assess whether speculation in the oil market played a role in driving this salient empirical pattern. We identify oil shocks from a large dataset using a dynamic factor model. This method is motivated by the fact that a small-scale vector autoregression is not informationally sufficient to identify the shocks. The main results are as follows. (i) While global demand shocks account for the largest share of oil price fluctuations, speculative shocks are the second most important driver. (ii) The increase in oil prices over the last decade is mainly driven by the strength of global demand. However, speculation played a significant role in the oil price increase between 2004 and 2008 and its subsequent collapse. (iii) The co-movement between oil prices and the prices of other commodities is mainly explained by global demand shocks. Our results support the view that the recent oil price increase is mainly driven by the strength of global demand but that the financialization process of commodity markets also played a role.}

Moreover, we find that possible explanations for predictability of commodity factors—the intertemporal asset pricing model and information diffusion explanation—are all inconsistent with our empirical results.},

Contrary to the popular belief that speculators are responsible for the recent commodity price fluctuation, my analysis finds no evidence that speculators destabilize the commodity spot market. Instead, speculators contribute to lower price volatility, enhanced price efficiency, and better liquidity in the commodity markets. More importantly, I show that speculators either have no effect or stabilize prices during periods of large price movement. My findings suggest speculators have had a significant and in fact positive influence on the commodity market during the recent ``financialization'' period, implying that restricting speculative trading in the futures market is not an efficient way to stabilize the commodity market.},

Are speculators partly to blame for these price changes? Using a simple model of supply and demand in the cash and storage markets, we determine whether speculation is consistent with data on production, inventory changes, and convenience yields. We focus on crude oil, but our approach can be applied to other commodities. We show speculation had little, if any, effect on oil prices.}

This pattern cannot be generated by standard models that emphasize storage. We develop an equilibrium model of oil production in which investment is irreversible and capacity constrained. Investment constraints affect firms' investment decisions and imply that the supply elasticity changes over time. Since demand shocks must be absorbed by changes in prices or changes in supply, time-varying supply elasticity results in time-varying volatility of futures prices. Estimating this model, we show it is quantitatively consistent with the V-shape relationship between the volatility of futures prices and the slope of the forward curve.},

We examine the effects of shocks to the common stochastic trends in the index positions, the spot and futures prices of Chicago corn and soybeans, WTI crude oil and Henry Hub natural gas.

The insider makes positive profits by exploiting his monopoly power optimally in a dynamic context, where noise trading provides camouflage which conceals his trading from market makers. As the time interval between auctions goes to zero, a limiting model of continuous trading is obtained. In this equilibrium, prices follow Brownian motion, the depth of the market is constant over time, and all private information is incorporated into prices by the end of trading.}

However, this entry may be detrimental to the producers, as they do not internalize the price reduction due to greater aggregate supply. In the presence of asymmetric information, speculation on the futures market serves as a learning device. The futures price and open interest reveal different pieces of private information regarding the supply and demand side of the spot market, respectively. When the accuracy of private information is low, the entry of new speculators makes both production and spot prices more volatile. The entry of new speculators typically increases the correlation between financial and commodity markets.},

We show that both the magnitude and volatility of BAS for inactive contracts exhibit U-shaped patterns, whereas active contracts' BAS increase only near their expiration. Inactive contracts are also of low liquidity risk after introducing market makers. On the basis of the simultaneous equation model, we find that BAS responds negatively to volume and positively to volatility and order imbalance. The impacts are larger in inactive contracts. Moreover, introducing market makers to inactive contracts is conducive to attracting trading and lowering trading costs.},

  abstract  = {A traditional philosophical controversy between representing general concepts as abstract sets or classes and representing concepts as concrete prototypes is reflected in a controversy between two mechanisms for sharing behavior between objects in object oriented programming languages. Inheritance splits the object world into classes, which encode behavior shared among a group of instances, which represent individual members of these sets. The class/instance distinction is not needed if the alternative of using prototypes is adopted. A prototype represents the default behavior for a concept, and new objects can re-use part of the knowledge stored in the prototype by saying how the new object differs from the prototype. The prototype approach seems to hold some advantages for representing default knowledge, and incrementally and dynamically modifying concepts. Delegation is the mechanism for implementing this in object oriented languages. After checking its idiosyncratic behavior, an object can forward a message to prototypes to invoke more general knowledge. Because class objects must be created before their instances can be used, and behavior can only be associated with classes, inheritance fixes the communication patterns between objects at instance creation time. Because any object can be used as a prototype, and any messages can be forwarded at any time, delegation is the more flexible and general of the two techniques.},

Every year, countless hours and significant resources are lost because of poorly written code. But it doesnt have to be that way.Noted software expert Robert C. Martin, presents a revolutionary paradigm with Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship. Martin, who has helped bring agile principles from a practitioners point of view to tens of thousands of programmers, has teamed up with his colleagues from Object Mentor to distill their best agile practice of cleaning code on the fly into a book that will instill within you the values of software craftsman, and make you a better programmerbut only if you work at it.What kind of work will you be doing? Youll be reading codelots of code. And you will be challenged to think about whats right about that code, and whats wrong with it. More importantly you will be challenged to reassess your professional values and your commitment to your craft. Clean Code is divided into three parts. The first describes the principles, patterns, and practices of writing clean code. The second part consists of several case studies of increasing complexity. Each case study is an exercise in cleaning up codeof transforming a code base that has some problems into one that is sound and efficient. The third part is the payoff: a single chapter containing a list of heuristics and smells gathered while creating the case studies. The result is a knowledge base that describes the way we think when we write, read, and clean code.Readers will come away from this book understandingHow to tell the difference between good and bad codeHow to write good code and how to transform bad code into good codeHow to create good names, good functions, good objects, and good classesHow to format code for maximum readability How to implement complete error handling without obscuring code logicHow to unit test and practice test-driven developmentWhat smells and heuristics can help you identify bad codeThis book is a must for any developer, software engineer, project manager, team lead, or systems analyst with an interest in producing better code.}

Nevertheless, its role as an efficient instrument for corporate governance has recently come under increasing scrutiny, and numerous proposals for reform have emerged as a result. The purpose of this paper is to assess the release of value-relevant information during the AGM by analysing its impact on returns, returns volatility, and trading volumes in a sample of common- and civil-law countries. In one of the most influential articles in the field of corporate governance, La Porta et al. (J Polit Econ 106:1113--1155, 1998) examine the relationship between legal systems and shareholder protection. Given the importance of a country's legal tradition regarding not only shareholders' rights but also the role they play in the company, we cannot assume on a prior basis that results obtained in countries in which the legal tradition is based on the common law, like the US and the UK, can be directly extrapolated to countries with different legal traditions. Our results emphasise the role of national idiosyncratic characteristics in the relevance of the AGM, although only among civil-law countries. Common-law countries, on the other hand, would show a more similar behaviour.}

  abstract = {The emerging financialization of commodity markets over the last decades has led to an intense public and scientific debate about commodity investing and its implications. Although metal commodities are indispensable to industry and the economy, the influence of financialization on metal spot prices and in particular on respective volatility has been insufficiently studied. Therefore, we attempt to contribute to existing literature by examining potential effects of the lead-lag relationship on futures trading activity of commercial and non-commercial market participants and cash prices and volatility for the major metal commodities: copper, gold, silver, platinum, and palladium. After analyzing Commitment of Traders (COT) reports from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) over a timeframe from January 1993 to December 2013, bi-directional Granger-causality tests and an EGARCH volatility analysis show that there is hardly any influence of trading activity driving metal spot prices in the long-term, but rather driving volatility to some extent. We find indications of price and volatility influencing effects of trading activity within sub-samples, such as phases of booms and crises. Contrary to public perception, commercial and long positions affect price levels and volatility far more than activities of non-commercial traders. However, for the reverse direction there is strong evidence that commodity prices and volatility drive trading positions.}

Our examination of the historical record results in three major criticisms of the author's research design: (1) lack of a control group, (2) an unsubstantiated test period, and (3) apparent misclassification of events (favorable/unfavorable/control) during the test period. We believe that these problems invalidate the conclusion that the Securities Act of 1933 had an adverse impact on stockholders' wealth.}

Futures risk premium is highly time-variant; notably, energy investors’ profits have been very limited in the GFC and post-GFC period, which coincided with the financialization of commodity markets.},

This correspondence is used to derive a unique equilibrium price structure of management fees which are independent of investors' preferences, endowments, or prior probability assessments for stock returns. Sufficient statistics for evaluating market-timing skills are derived, and it is shown that the number of correct forecasts is not a useful statistic for this purpose.}

The book is the gospel of object-oriented technology and it deserves to be spread everywhere. Meyer opens with coverage of the need for an object-oriented approach to software development, citing improved quality and development speed as key advantages of the approach. He then explains all the key criteria that define an object- oriented approach to a problem. Meyer pays attention to techniques, such as classes, objects, memory management, and more, returning to each technique and polishing his readers' knowledge of it as he explains how to employ it well. In a section on advanced topics, Meyer explores interesting and relevant topics, such as persistent objects stored in a database. He also offers a sort of Do and Don't section in which he enumerates common mistakes and ways to avoid them. Management information isn't the main point of Object-Oriented Software Construction, but you'll find some in its pages. Meyer concludes his tour de force with comparisons of all the key object-oriented languages, including Java. He also covers the potential of simulating object technology in non-object-oriented languages, such as Pascal and Fortran.},

Pit traders were particularly distressed by a 400\% increase in the tax rate in 1932 and effectively widened spreads by avoiding trades at the minimum price increment. This doubling of the minimum tick size was formally implemented in exchange rules 1 year later.},

A diversified portfolio of time series momentum strategies across all asset classes delivers substantial abnormal returns with little exposure to standard asset pricing factors and performs best during extreme markets.

The main result of this paper shows that larger firms with greater trade partner diversification have lower basis risk. Such firms align their internal transaction price closer to the common spot price in the market, which encourages greater futures market participation. Results are discussed in light of recent declines in participation in the salmon futures exchange.},

  abstract = {We examine target firms' price run-ups prior to takeovers in two different exchange regulatory environments within the same country. We show that target firms listed both in the secondary market of the UK, known as the Alternative Investment Market (AIM), and in the traditionally regulated Main Market, experience significant abnormal stock returns prior to takeover announcements. These results persist after controlling for market anticipation, indicating signs of information leakage. Contrary to the narrative that secondary markets may be more susceptible to market abusive behaviors, we find that the AIM targets experience significantly lower pre-announcement returns. In addition, we do not find support that the introduction of stricter laws reduces the price run-ups in any of the two markets. In sharp contrast, we find support that the enforcement of insider trading laws, through criminal convictions, reduces the pre-announcement abnormal stock returns but only in the market in which the enforcement focuses.}

Design/methodology/approach This paper studies the relationship between the clustering of annual general meetings and stock returns in the SSE. A multivariate analysis is carried out in order to analyse the relationship between monthly returns and the clustering of general meetings in the SSE. Findings The authors show that meeting clustering exists and that some months exhibit significant and positive additional returns related to the holding of ordinary or extraordinary general meetings. Research limitations/implications The authors have explored some possible explanations for the meeting clustering effect, such as a potential link with the ``Halloween'' effect or the presence of higher-than-normal levels of volatility, trading volumes or investor attention. However, none of these can explain the meeting clustering effect that emerges as a new anomaly in the SSE. Practical implications The authors have documented significant and positive abnormal returns in some months that coincide with the holding of general meetings. Therefore, the holding of ordinary and/or extraordinary meetings in some months involves the release of relevant information for investors. Originality/value This study complements the financial literature because it is focused on the clustering of meetings and its effect on a stock market whose legal order is based on civil law. This fact allows us to shed new light on meeting clustering and its effect on other types of markets.}

  abstract  = {Purpose Annual general meetings have been variously described as dull rituals for accountability versus entertaining theatre at the expense of accountability. The research analyses director and shareholder participation and dialogic interactions at annual and extraordinary general meetings of Cecil Rhodes' British South Africa Company (BSAC). The BSAC was incorporated under a royal charter in 1889 in return for power to exploit a huge territory, Rhodesia/now Zimbabwe. The BSAC's administration ceased in 1924/25. Thus, the BSAC had a dual mandate as a private for-profit listed company and to occupy and develop the territories on behalf of the British government. Design/methodology/approach The article analyses 29 BSAC general meeting minutes, comprising 25 full sets of verbatim minutes between 1895 and 1925. The study adopts manual content analysis. First, the research adopts conversational analysis to analyse director and shareholder turn-taking and moves by approving and dissenting shareholders. Second, the study identifies and analyses incidents of shareholder sentiment from the shareholder turns/moves. Finally, the article assesses how shareholder sentiment changed throughout the period and whether the BSAC's share price reflected the shareholder sentiment. Findings The BSAC's general meetings were associated with the greater colonial project of building the British Empire. The authors find almost 1,500 incidents of shareholder sentiment. Directors and shareholders take roughly an equal number of turns (excluding shareholder sentiment). Ritual and ceremony dominate director and shareholder turns and moves, while accountability to shareholders was minimal. The BSAC share price spiked in the early years of the project, waning after that. Shareholder sentiment, both positive and negative, reflect the share price behaviour. Originality/value A unique database of verbatim general meeting minutes records shareholders' reactions to what they heard in the form of sounding off through cheering, ``hear, hears,'' laughter and applause (i.e. shareholder sentiment).}

A simple one-factor model based on the first principal component extracted from a panel of commodity returns outperforms a macroeconomic model, and explains most of the realized comovements. We find that intersectoral correlations display more time variations than intrasectoral correlations. Dissecting the evidence further, we find that comovements are driven by the variation of the factor as opposed to exposure to it. Our results cast doubt on the persistence of the effects of financialization and emphasize the importance of the dynamics of the factor variance.},

R2s were calculated for the returns of large stocks as explained by systematic economic influences, by the returns on other stocks in the same industry, and by public firm-specific news events. The average adjusted R2 is only about .35 with monthly data and .20 with daily data. There is little relation between explanatory power and either the firm's size or its industry. There is little improvement in R2 from eliminating all dates surrounding news reports in the financial press. However, the sample kurtosis is quite different when such news events are eliminated, thereby revealing a mixture of return distributions. Non-news dates also indicate the presence of a distributional mixture, perhaps due to traders acting on private information.},

We re-examine some of the early papers in the literature using recent data and find that the empirical support for the theory of normal backwardation as an explanation for the commodity risk premium is weak and that the evidence is more consistent with storage decisions. We then review the behavior of the main participants in the commodity futures markets with a particular focus on their impact on prices. Although there is continued disagreement in the literature about the role of speculative activity, our results show that money managers are generally momentum (positive feedback) traders, while producers are net short and contrarian (negative feedback) traders. There is less evidence that index traders and swap dealers trade based on past futures returns.}

The Dynamic Conditional Correlation model (2002) and Diebold–Yilmaz spillover index (2012) are employed to ascertain the presence, pattern, direction, and magnitude of the connectedness between the returns of base metal futures and related equity indices over the period of 2006–2019. The study builds on a less-studied “input” channel of linkage between the two, reckoning with the economic fundamentals of demand–supply interaction. Our results show that 36\% of the return forecast error variance originates from spillovers, to which the contribution of equity indices is minimal. It indicates segmentation between the two markets which offer the scope for potential diversification. Further, base metal futures are the net transmitters and equity indices are the net recipients of spillovers. Positive correlations outweigh the negative correlations, in both frequency and magnitude.},

Ebenso wird er stets bestimmte Preisgefälle in der Zeit hervorrufen, wobei man dem zukünftigen Preis einer Ware, soweit die Kenntnis aller einschlägigen Faktoren reicht, niemals erlauben wird, den gegenwärtigen Preis um mehr als die Kosten der Speicherung zu übersteigen. Die Theorie der Spekulation, auf der all dies beruht, ist äußerst kompliziert auf Grund der überall wirksamen Unsicherheit über die Zukunft. Die vorliegende Arbeit gibt also einen Überblick über die exakten Beziehungen, die auf einem idealen Warenmarkt unter der abstrakten und idealen Voraussetzung einer vollkommenen Kenntnis aller Faktoren herrschen würden. Im besonderen wird dargelegt, wie eine vorhergesehene oder unvorhergesehene Störung das Preisgefälle und den Verbrauch verschiedener Ernteperioden beeinflußt. In einem Anhang werden einige der interessanten mathematischen Probleme, die mit der reinen Theorie der Spekulation zusammenhängen, entwickelt. Eine intuitive Darlegung der Grundprinzipien kann allerdings einfach dadurch erreicht werden, daß man die Diagramme der elementaren Außenhandelstheorie verwendet. Schließlich werden einige Bemerkungen zu bestimmten Wirkungen der Unsicherheit vorgetragen. Insbesondere wird die Auffassung kritisiert, nach der jeder erfolgreich Spekulierende damit schon als ein Wohltäter der Gesamtheit angesehen werden muß, der in seinem Gewinn den "verdienten" Lohn empfängt. Wer eine Sekunde eher als die anderen den Schleier der Ungewißheit durchschaut, kann Riesengewinne erzielen, ohne daß es für die gesamte Wirtschaft irgendeine Bedeutung hat, ob die Anpassung des Preises eine Sekunde früher oder später geschieht.}

The first model is a simple one-factor model in which the logarithm of the spot price of the commodity is assumed to follow a mean reverting process. The second model takes into account a second stochastic factor, the convenience yield of the commodity, which is assumed to follow a mean reverting process. Finally, the third model also includes stochastic interest rates. The Kalman filter methodology is used to estimate the parameters of the three models for two commercial commodities, copper and oil, and one precious metal, gold. The analysis reveals strong mean reversion in the commercial commodity prices. Using the estimated parameters, we analyze the implications of the models for the term structure of futures prices and volatilities beyond the observed contracts, and for hedging contracts for future delivery. Finally, we analyze the implications of the models for capital budgeting decisions.}

Using the network approach, we find that gold futures are a global leader in price discovery and volatility spillover. However, during 2016–2018, physical-gold-backed ETF and spot challenge the futures' leadership in New York and Shanghai. Intraday variation in price discovery leadership is due to liquidity, hedging effectiveness, price jumps, investor attention, and macroeconomic states.},

My main result shows that financial innovation always increases the speculative variance through two distinct channels: by generating new bets and by amplifying traders' existing bets. When disagreements are large, these effects are sufficiently strong that financial innovation increases average portfolio risks, decreases average portfolio comovements, and generates greater speculative trading volume relative to risk-sharing volume. Moreover, a profit-seeking market maker endogenously introduces speculative assets that increase average portfolio risks. JEL Codes: G11, G12, D53.},

I argue that informational frictions and the associated speculative activity may induce prices to drift away from ``fundamental'' values, and may result in price booms and busts. Particular attention is given to the interplay between imperfect information about real economic activity, including supply, demand, and inventory accumulation, and speculative activity in oil markets. Furthermore, I present new evidence that there were economically and statistically significant effects of investor flows on futures prices, after controlling for returns in the United States and emerging-economy stock markets, a measure of the balance sheet flexibility of large financial institutions, open interest, the futures/spot basis, and lagged returns on oil futures. The largest impacts on futures prices were from intermediate-term growth rates of index positions and managed-money spread positions. Moreover, my findings suggest that these effects were through risk or informational channels distinct from changes in convenience yield. Finally, the evidence suggests that hedge fund trading in spread positions in futures impacted the shape of term structure of oil futures prices. This paper was accepted by Wei Xiong, finance.}

  abstract  = {Object-oriented programming is a practical and useful programming methodology that encourages modular design and software reuse. Most object-oriented programming languages support data abstraction by preventing an object from being manipulated except via its defined external operations. In most languages, however, the introduction of inheritance severely compromises the benefits of this encapsulation. Furthermore, the use of inheritance itself is globally visible in most languages, so that changes to the inheritance hierarchy cannot be made safely. This paper examines the relationship between inheritance and encapsulation and develops requirements for full support of encapsulation with inheritance.},

By aggregating dispersed information about the strength of the global economy among goods producers whose production has complementarity, commodity prices serve as price signals to guide producers' production decisions and commodity demand. Our model highlights important feedback effects of informational noise originating from supply shocks and futures market trading on commodity demand and spot prices. Our analysis illustrates the weakness common in empirical studies on commodity markets of assuming that different types of shocks are publicly observable to market participants.},

The mispricing factors aggregate information across 11 prominent anomalies by averaging rankings within two clusters exhibiting the greatest return co-movement. Investor sentiment predicts the mispricing factors, especially their short legs, consistent with a mispricing interpretation and the asymmetry in ease of buying versus shorting. A three-factor model with a single mispricing factor also performs well, especially in Bayesian model comparisons.Received July 4, 2015; accepted November 29, 2016 by Editor Robin Greenwood.}},

  abstract  = {Die Nachkriegsdiskussion über internationale Rohstoffprobleme hat dazu geführt, daß man einen festen Kurs zwischen der Skylla der Instabilität einerseits und der Charybdis der monopolistischen Praktiken seitens der Erzeuger oder Verbraucher von Rohstoffen anderseits anstrebte. In der Diskussion wurde fast gar nicht auf die Funktionen organisierter Rohstoffmärkte Bezug genommen, was allerdings überraschend ist, da organisierte Märkte sehr wohl gerade gegen Instabilität des Marktes und monopolistische Praktiken Schutz gewähren könnten. Die Aufgaben von Rohstoffmärkten werden teilweise durch Börsen und teilweise durch die Handelstätigkeit verschiedener Gruppen, die an der Rohstoffbörse operieren, übernommen. Der Aufsatz enthält auch eine Erörterung der Strukturmerkmale, die bewirken, daß die Terminmärkte dem theoretischen vollkommenen Wettbewerb nahekommen. Es wird ferner die Frage behandelt, wie die verschiedenen Kategorien von Händlern eine enge Preisbeziehung zwischen den verschiedenen Märkten herstellen. Der Einfluß der Entwicklung des Nachkriegshandels auf Rohstoff-Terminmärkte wird diskutiert. Es wird festgestellt, daß der Handel auf zahlreichen Märkten in den sechziger Jahren zugenommen hat, während andere Märkte in einem bösen Zirkel der Stagnation zurückblieben. Die Untersuchung ergibt, daß ein richtiges Funktionieren der organisierten Märkte die Koordinierung der nationalen Rohstoffpolitik und der internationalen Rohstoffabkommen erfordert.}

  abstract  = {This thesis consists of five empirical studies, all relating to shareholder activism at annual general meetings. The first study concerns the structure and content of general meetings in Denmark and Sweden comparatively. The paper reveals significant differences in the level of activism, with Swedish investors being the most active in terms of proposals, proxy voting, and `voice'. The paper takes a legal approach, and discusses divergence in activism levels from the perspective of shareholder prerequisites to engage in monitoring efforts. Further, the paper investigating the topics addressed through questions and opinions. The results show that matters which can be categorized as irrelevant are reasonably rare. This is an important finding, as suggestions to abolish general meetings have often been based on the assumption that general meetings facilitate nothing but irrelevant, time consuming, and costly discussions that serves no monitoring function. The second study analyses the impact of voting power on shareholder activism. We hypothesize that there is a positive relationship between shareholder activism and a measure of the largest shareholder's sensitivity to increased participation by small shareholders and find that firms' amenability to small shareholder influence leads to more proposals by the nomination committee, but fewer proposals by other shareholders. We interpret this as evidence that the shareholder elected nomination committees effectively channel shareholder concerns and preempt other kinds of activism. Politicians and companies that desire active shareholders could improve the amenability of firms to shareholder influence by ownership transparency, shareholder committees, and contacts with shareholder associations and other vehicles for collective action...},

This paper describes the Mesa programming facilities of the Xerox Development Environment (XDE). It is interesting for several reasons. It has existed in something similar to its current form for about 5 years. It has more than 500 users, many interacting with it 8 or more hours a day. Several million lines of code have been written by these users, including large, multi-author systems.Previous papers have dealt with the Mesa language [Geschke77, Mitchell79], the operating system [Redell79, Lampson80] and the processor architecture on which it runs [Johnsson82, Sweet82]. This paper describes the programming environment: the user illusion, the set of programming tools, and the facilities available for augmenting the environment. Section 2 gives a short history of the environment, including some of our original design goals. Section 3 describes the current state of the user interface and discusses a few of the schemes that were tried and discarded. Section 4 describes some of the program development tools available and discusses how features of the language have influenced their design, and indeed influenced what tools are in the set. Section 5 describes other tools that, although valuable to the programming task, are largely language independent. Section 6 talks about how easy it is to make additions to the system, and gives examples of user additions—some that modify the environment and some that simply provide new tools. Section 7 discusses what we feel are major successes and what we feel needs to be done in the future.},

This is shown via simulating trajectories of a joint stochastic volatility–stochastic correlation model. Results indicate that an unnecessarily large overmargin requirement is set by regulators when the applied risk measure is not calculated via a portfoliowise treatment. Finally, accounting for the correlation structure of the assets during the margining process would not lead to an overly prudent method, nor would it cause greater procyclicality.},

Historically, futures markets first emerged for the annual crops that could be continuously stored (grain and cotton); hence inventory hedging has been important from the outset. But forward pricing which was not attendant upon inventories has long been practiced, and the more recent emergence of futures markets for non-inventory commodities dramatizes this fact. We show here that the model of intertemporal price relationships differs for the two cases and provide evidence for selected commodities. The contrasting implications for allocation and stabilization are also drawn.}

We find that the information content of earnings announcements has increased significantly over time, and this finding holds true for both interim and preliminary earnings announcements. We find evidence that earnings announcements with June year-ends exhibit a higher level of information content and experience a more pronounced rising trend as compared to earnings announcements with non-June year-ends. Several firm characteristics appear to relate to the level of the information content of earnings announcements as well as to compound the trend over time. We document an important finding that the information content of earnings announcements increases remarkably in the period after the adoption of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).},

A critical aspect is how the parameters of these functions change with the introduction of the future market as it is through these induced parameter changes that the futures market exerts its influence on the spot price. The effects of the futures market on both the long-run average spot price and its variance are analyzed. While we are unable to draw any definitive conclusions on this issue, we find that in all cases considered the futures market stabilizes the spot price, as well as lowering its long-run mean.}

The allocation of the benefits from a futures market to the various groups in the economy is discussed andthe present results related to those of the more traditional buffer stock literature. Finally, the degree of stability provided by a futures market is compared with that obtained by active market intervention by a stabilization authority.}

The following assumptions are made: (A.1) The instantaneous (spot) interest rate follows a diffusion process; (A.2) the price of a discount bond depends only on the spot rate over its term; and (A.3) the market is efficient. Under these assumptions, it is shown by means of an arbitrage argument that the expected rate of return on any bond in excess of the spot rate is proportional to its standard deviation. This property is then used to derive a partial differential equation for bond prices. The solution to that equation is given in the form of a stochastic integral representation. An interpretation of the bond pricing formula is provided. The model is illustrated on a specific case.}

We find that after controlling for market risk factors, speculators are contrarians, but respond positively to market sentiment. In contrast, hedgers engage in positive feedback trading and trade against market sentiment. We also find that trades of speculators (hedgers) are positively (negatively) correlated with subsequent abnormal returns; however, it does not appear that speculators possess superior forecasting power. Therefore, hedging pressure effects likely explain the negative relation between the performance of speculators and hedgers. The positive feedback trading by hedgers together with their negative performance suggests that hedgers have a destabilizing impact on futures prices. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract  = {This paper presents a parameter covariance matrix estimator which is consistent even when the disturbances of a linear regression model are heteroskedastic. This estimator does not depend on a formal model of the structure of the heteroskedasticity. By comparing the elements of the new estimator to those of the usual covariance estimator, one obtains a direct test for heteroskedasticity, since in the absence of heteroskedasticity, the two estimators will be approximately equal, but will generally diverge otherwise. The test has an appealing least squares interpretation.}

However, these initial price reactions are incomplete.

Further analysis suggests that stock returns of oil-related companies are more closely align to Brent and WTI's futures returns following China's key oil pricing reform on March 27, 2013. Overall, Chinese industries are also more exposed to global crude oil futures volatility after this event.},

  abstract  = {The second edition of this acclaimed graduate text provides a unified treatment of two methods used in contemporary econometric research, cross section and data panel methods. By focusing on assumptions that can be given behavioral content, the book maintains an appropriate level of rigor while emphasizing intuitive thinking. The analysis covers both linear and nonlinear models, including models with dynamics and/or individual heterogeneity. In addition to general estimation frameworks (particular methods of moments and maximum likelihood), specific linear and nonlinear methods are covered in detail, including probit and logit models and their multivariate, Tobit models, models for count data, censored and missing data schemes, causal (or treatment) effects, and duration analysis.Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data was the first graduate econometrics text to focus on microeconomic data structures, allowing assumptions to be separated into population and sampling assumptions. This second edition has been substantially updated and revised. Improvements include a broader class of models for missing data problems; more detailed treatment of cluster problems, an important topic for empirical researchers; expanded discussion of "generalized instrumental variables" (GIV) estimation; new coverage (based on the author's own recent research) of inverse probability weighting; a more complete framework for estimating treatment effects with panel data, and a firmly established link between econometric approaches to nonlinear panel data and the "generalized estimating equation" literature popular in statistics and other fields. New attention is given to explaining when particular econometric methods can be applied; the goal is not only to tell readers what does work, but why certain "obvious" procedures do not. The numerous included exercises, both theoretical and computer-based, allow the reader to extend methods covered in the text and discover new insights.},

  abstract = {Abstract This study examines the volatility connectedness of commodity futures markets by decomposing connectedness at high, medium, and low frequencies using a LASSO-VAR model. The total volatility connectedness across commodities is substantial and fluctuates within the range of 30\%–60\%, which is largely driven by low-frequency volatility connectedness. Energy futures as a group and crude oil and soybeans as individual commodities play dominant roles as net senders of volatility shocks in the system of 25 commodities. Commodity volatility spillovers at medium and particularly low frequency account for over 40\% of the total volatility connectedness, which can be significantly explained by economic factors related to broad economic conditions; however, this is not the case at high frequency. This finding implies that the effect of the financialization of commodities might be more limited than previously assumed.},

We find that the IC effect is substantially positive and continues to grow as the financialization of commodities deepens. Positive and negative IC risks play asymmetric roles, with the effect of negative IC strengthening in recent subperiods. We further confirm the heterogeneous roles of IC across individual commodities by cross-section analyses. Overall, the effect of the positive IC risk factor varies significantly. Portfolios with low basis, low open interest, low momentum, and low liquidity earn significantly higher returns than counterparty portfolios.},

The overall effect of ICR is negative and more significant for the post-2008 period, although positive and negative ICR play asymmetric roles. Furthermore, we identify a heterogeneous structure of dependence across the volatility distribution as ICR strengthens toward upper volatility percentiles, whereas financialization in commodities flattens this dynamic trace. Finally, the ability of ICR to convey economic news is the most economically important source of the dependence.},

In this study, we empirically investigate the asset pricing implications of probability weighting in commodity markets. We find that commodities with a high probability-weighting value significantly underperform their low-value pairs by 11\% per annum. Neither conventional commodity risk factors nor existing characteristics explain this predictability. The predictability is more pronounced when arbitrage constraints are more binding. Commodities with a high probability-weighting value also attract excess demand from non-commercial traders. Collectively, these findings support a prospect theory-based explanation for the cross-section of commodity returns.},

Specifically, oil shocks driven by demand lower stock liquidity, whereas oil supply shocks have the opposite effect. Generally large corporations are more affected by oil demand and supply shocks. Further analysis reveals that oil, oil-related, oil-user and the broad market categories are most affected by oil shocks, but the effects on oil-substitutes are minimum.},

This paper investigates the COVID-19 impact on the interdependence between the US and Chinese oil futures markets by extending the dynamic conditional correlation-generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (DCC-GARCH) models with incorporating COVID-19 variables and by applying vector autoregression (VAR) models. Our study reveals that the COVID-19 pandemic enhanced the long-run correlation between the two oil markets. In contrast, daily changes in pandemic severity had a negative effect on the short-term transient correlation. Our results show that COVID-19 changed the one-direction causality from the US oil market to the Chinese market in the pre-COVID period to a bidirectional causal relation between the two markets during the COVID period. It strengthened the volatility spillover effect from the Chinese to US markets. These findings are helpful to regulars' monitoring oil supply chain risk and investors' cross-market hedging of spillover risks from a systematic risk perspective.},
