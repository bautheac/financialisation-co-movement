<!-- Conclusion {#conclusion} -->
<!-- ============ -->
<p>In the early 2000s, against a backdrop of a low yield environment and poor stock market performance, a combination of financial innovations<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> and regulatory changes<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> led to large inflows of institutional capital into the commodity futures markets. This process known as “financialisation” spurred a heated public policy debate about whether the ensuing increase in open interest and trading volume in commodity futures exerted upward pressure on prices. The debate spread to the legislative sphere, with the US senate launching formal investigations, and was thrust onto the academic community as a matter of urgency. Perhaps in response to this, most of the early studies focused on the more mechanical effects of financialisation, relying on commodity specific causality and correlation-based analysis. The contention eventually triggered legislative action and new position limits were introduced in a number of grains and energy futures markets with substantial potential effects on their functioning and consequently, to a larger extent, on that of the economic system as a whole. With the benefit of hindsight, the focus of the debate appears to have been too narrow, and the ensuing regulatory changes might thus have been unwarranted; it therefore seems important to analyse the effects of financialisation from a broader perspective which we do in this study. Factor model techniques are well suited to isolating common driving factors and detecting co-movement, a central issue in financialisation which we believe the existing literature has not fully analysed; we thus consider the entire cross-section of actively traded commodities on futures markets and use a futures-based asset pricing framework that includes factors constructed using both theoretical fundamentals and liquidity considerations. Our analysis suggests that, beyond energy and agriculturals, financialisation appears to have had a substantial impact on the metals sector at the global level. The onset of the financial crisis and the monetary policy regimes that followed, on the other hand, also appear to have induced significant changes in commodity pricing dynamics. In contrast with financialisation, our results suggest that the crisis and its aftermath have delivered an exogenous shock across the entire cross-section of liquid commodities and seem to have set off a motion of reversion to legacy pre-financialisation fundamentals, in other words, a process of “definancialisation” in global commodity futures markets.</p>

<li id="fn17"><p>Commodity price indexes and the ad-hoc financial instruments enabling investment in them were the main financial innovations which allowed large global banks to offer commodity investment products to institutional and retail investors. In 1991 Goldman Sachs created the S&amp;P-GSCI which provides investors with buy-side exposure to commodities via the OTC swap market and thus without having to participate in the formal futures markets with their position limit restrictions. At this stage, these restrictions still applied to the issuing institutions though, as they hedged the corresponding commodity swap exposure in the futures markets. The first commodity-based ETFs were created through buying physical precious metals with gold and silver ETFs offered as early as 2002/2003. The regulatory hurdle here related to the licensing of commodity trading professionals. Typically, investors had to sign a statement with their broker stating that they understood the risks of commodity investments; a rather inconvenient paperwork for a product designed to trade like a stock, as set forth by a number of industry players at the time.<a href="conclusion.html#fnref17" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn18"><p>In 2000, the Commodity Futures Modernization Act (CFMA) granted non-agricultural commodity futures statutory exemption from regulation (“Enron loophole”). It still required agricultural commodity derivatives be traded on a CFTC-regulated exchange however. Eventually, the CFTC classified swap dealers as “bona fide” hedgers, granting them position limits exemption (“swap dealer loophole”). In 2005, the CFTC waived the rule that required commodity investors to sign a statement saying they understood the risks, letting the funds replace it with their prospectus. The regulatory bottleneck that prevented the large-scale expansion of commodity index investment was no more.<a href="conclusion.html#fnref18" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
