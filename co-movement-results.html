<!-- =================== -->
<p>The descriptive statistics for the commodity series considered in the study displayed in table <a href="tables.html#tab:co-movement-stats-no-regimes">1</a> show a clear pattern of increase in average return during financialisation with an equally weighted portfolio of the US traded assets showing a mean returns of 15.9% significant at the 5% level vs. 6.9% with a 10% significance in the pre-financialisation period. The increase is even more pronounced for an equally weighted portfolio of UK traded assets (metals), 2.47% (not significant) to 21.8% (significant at the 10% level), which sets out the global nature of the phenomenon. Most commodities show a higher mean return while five–Lumber (XCME), Natural gas (XNYM), Palladium (XNYM), Platinum (XNYM) and Nickel-primary (XLME)–show a lower figure with five significant figures–Crude oil-WTI (XNYM), Heating oil (XNYM), Copper (XCEC), Copper (XLME) and Tin-refined (XLME)–against none pre-financialisation. Sugar-#11 wins the race with a mean return increasing from -4.6% to 24.9% followed by copper with sizeable increases for both markets: 1.5% to 28.2% (XCEC) and 0.5% to 28.6% (XLME).<br />
The pattern of results for volatilities is similar although the increase is less pronounced. Both equally weighted portfolios shows an increase, more pronounced for the UK assets, 10% to 13.6% (US) vs. 15.7% to 26.9% (UK), while out of the thirty assets, eleven show a drop in volatility: Oats (XCBT), Lean hogs (XCME), Cocoa (IFUS), Coffee-C (IFUS), Lumber (XCME), Sugar-#11 (IFUS), Natural gas (XNYM), Crude oil-WTI (XNYM), Gasoline (XNYM), Heating oil (XNYM), Palladium (XNYM). Financialisation seems however to have impacted the commodity complex beyond these mechanical effects of increased long participation ensuing from the entry on index type investments as our results suggest next.</p>
<p>The cross-sectional nature of financialisation naturally leads us to extend the individual hedging pressure paradigm by incorporating aggregate CHP (<strong>CHP</strong>), a market wide measure of hedging pressure. The traditional Keynesian hedging pressure paradigm postulates a negative relationship between the return on an individual commodity futures and its hedging pressure. The extended Keynesian hedging pressure paradigm, in the context of financialisation, should also imply that returns for individual commodities should be high in periods where <strong>CHP</strong> is low and vice et versa. In table <a href="tables.html#tab:co-movement-stats-regimes">2</a> the mean returns are shown over high (<strong>contango</strong>) and low (<strong>backwardation</strong>) <strong>CHP</strong> regimes for each time period.<br />
Over the first period eighteen of the twenty-four US commodities have higher mean returns during periods of <strong>backwardation</strong> as compared to <strong>contango</strong>, with the difference being statistically significant at the 10% level for two commodities, at the 5% level for one and at the 1% level for another. For the remaining six commodities the higher mean return during <strong>contango</strong> is not statistically significant for any of them. For the six UK commodities, all metals, five of them had higher mean returns during phases of <strong>backwardation</strong> as compared to <strong>contango</strong> in the first period, with one of these differences being statistically significant at the 10% level while for the remaining asset (Zinc) the higher mean return during <strong>contango</strong> is not statistically significant. An equally weighted portfolio of the twenty-four US commodities had a mean return of 15.4% during <strong>backwardation</strong> phases, statistically significant at the 1% level, and a mean return of -1.1% during <strong>contango</strong>, both in the first period, with the difference between them statistically significant at the 5% level. The corresponding figures for an equally weighted portfolio of the UK metals were 4.4% and 0.3% respectively. These results provide broad support for an aggregate version of the Keynesian hedging pressure hypothesis and suggest that hedgers in the aggregate were engaged in risk transfer during this period.<br />
Over the second period the pattern essentially reverses. For the twenty-four US commodities over this period, fourteen have higher mean returns during phases of <strong>contango</strong> over <strong>backwardation</strong>. Four of the six UK metals achieved higher mean returns over <strong>contango</strong> relative to <strong>backwardation</strong> phases with the difference being statistically significant for one commodity. The equally weighted US portfolio had a mean return of 15.7% over <strong>backwardation</strong> against 16.2% during phases of <strong>contango</strong>, both statistically significant at the 10% level. The difference was considerably more pronounced for the equally weighted UK metals portfolio with a mean return of 8% during <strong>backwardation</strong> rising to 35.6% during <strong>contango</strong>.</p>
<p>The onset of financialisation thus seems to have engendered a change in the nature of hedger’s behaviour, at the aggregate level in particular, taking it away from the traditional Keynesian view of risk shifting. This phenomenon has been noted in earlier theoretical and empirical work <span class="citation">(Danthine 1978; Stout 1998)</span> in different contexts from which two competing models of behaviour have emerged.<br />
The information arbitrage model <span class="citation">(Grossman and Stiglitz 1980; Danthine 1978; Kyle 1989)</span> implies that hedgers may often be seeking out counterparties to trade with rather than being purely passive. This issue is also raised in both <span class="citation">Cheng and Xiong (2014)</span> and <span class="citation">Stulz (1996)</span> who point out that hedgers may be taking a view on prices just as speculators do. In fact, by hedging away some of their risk, hedgers are able to speculate more heavily based on their disagreement against speculators regarding futures price movement <span class="citation">(Simsek 2013)</span>, which fits into a heterogeneous expectation theory of speculation<a href="references.html#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a>. As <span class="citation">Stout (1998)</span> points out, this disagreement-based theory of trading is one of the main reason the public and the law disapproves speculation as this form of trading is regarded as non-productive<a href="references.html#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a>.<br />
In the second model hedgers are seen as liquidity providers as in <span class="citation">Kang, Rouwenhorst, and Tang (2020)</span> with this explanation also consistent with the nature of financialisation which led to the arrival of long term, long only investors who require substantial liquidity to roll-over their positions. Table <a href="tables.html#tab:co-movement-time-reg-US-CHP">3</a> supports this view. We regress commodity futures front returns on individual commercial hedging pressure (CHP) as well as aggregate CHP (<strong>CHP</strong>), our market wide measure of CHP, in separate models and find that the explanatory power of CHP at the individual commodity level decreases over the financialisation period with the US cross-sectional average <span class="math inline">\(R^{2}\)</span> falling down to 20.8% from 25.8% in the previous period while that of <strong>CHP</strong> increases (7.1% vs 5.4%). Financialisation therefore seems to have had the effect of loosening the extent to which futures risk premiums relate to commodity specific commercial hedging motives while strengthening that to which they relate to broader dynamics such as cross-sectional liquidity provision. The pattern is strongest for the metals sector where the average <span class="math inline">\(R^{2}\)</span> drops down to 19.1% from 28.1% between the two periods at the individual level while it rises from 8.4% to 15.7% at the aggregate level. The symmetry breaks in the crisis period, with the US cross-sectional average <span class="math inline">\(R^{2}\)</span> at the individual level bouncing back up (22.5% vs 20.8%) while that at the aggregate level rises further (14.7% vs 7.1%), before eventually resuming post-crisis with a further rise at the individual level (27.2% vs 22.5%) and a drop at the aggregate level (7.5% vs 14.7%) suggesting a return to legacy commodity specific dynamics.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Using our bespoke commodity-based asset pricing framework we strive to shed new light on the phenomenon by first regressing returns series for the twenty four individual US commodities against our factor mimicking portfolios independently. The resulting individual explanatory powers (<span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span>s), once averaged by factor and period, offer a refined perspective on the relation between return and factor attribute co-movement. A low figure indicates low cross-sectional return co-movement for, in this context, return on the corresponding factor mimicking portfolio only has explanatory power on return for commodities that are constituents of one of its legs over the corresponding period. The explanatory power for the other commodities is typically low or even 0 for the case where commodities are perfectly uncorrelated with one-another. A rising figure on the other hand thus indicates increased pairwise correlations, positive or negative, including amongst factor leg mimicking portfolio constituent commodities. and therefore provides evidence that pairwise return correlation relates to factor attribute.<br />
The average time series explanatory power of the various one factor models on the US traded assets over the four periods is shown in Table <a href="tables.html#tab:co-movement-time-reg-US-facts-US">4</a>. Over the first period the market factor has the best average time series performance with the highest average <span class="math inline">\(R^{2}\)</span> with all three futures market factors performing poorly, indicating that the commodities with extreme factor attributes (high or low CHP for example) are uncorrelated with the rest of the commodity cross-section, and the overall performance consistent across periods of high and low <strong>CHP</strong> (below period median). The two factor models average <span class="math inline">\(R^{2}\)</span>s (results available on the <a href="http://18.135.131.217:3838/financialization-asset-pricing/">online results dashboard</a>) are roughly the sum of the one factor <span class="math inline">\(R^{2}\)</span>s indicating that the factors are almost orthogonal over this period.<br />
The onset of financialisation leads to a substantial improvement in the performance of the CHP factor with its average <span class="math inline">\(R^{2}\)</span> increasing to 8.2% in the second period relative to 1.7% in the first with this improvement coming from the long leg that shows a greater improvement (4.5% to 15.1%) relative to the short (3% to 4%), suggesting that “normally” backwardated commodities (Keynesian perspective) have higher correlation with the rest of the commodity cross-section, and thereby bringing more evidence of the important role played by long only investors in the change in nature of these markets over that period. The performance of the market factor also improves though not by as much in a relative sense (21.6% from 11.7%) and both the term structure factor and the open interest growth factor show a much smaller improvement in performance with smaller differences between legs. Over all periods, all of our factor models show similar performance across regimes of high and low <strong>CHP</strong>.</p>
<p>We next investigate the top eight of the US traded commodities which achieved the highest time series <span class="math inline">\(R^{2}\)</span> for the CHP, market, open interest and term structure factors, in each of the four time periods with the commodity picks shown in Table <a href="tables.html#tab:co-movement-picks">5</a>.<br />
For the CHP factor the commodities that achieve high <span class="math inline">\(R^{2}\)</span> in a given period are likely to be those with relatively high or low CHP over that period, or those commodities that co-vary with the short or the long side of the factor. The same applies to the open interest and term structure factors with CHP replaced by open interest growth and roll yield respectively; while for the market factor the picks are those that co-vary most strongly with the market factor over that period.<br />
For the CHP factor, we observe a change in the picks between the first and the second period; the picks in the first period included five agricultural commodities and three metals while in the second period they include all the five base and precious metals and only three agricultural commodities. This pattern is also visible for the term structure factor for which there are four metals (copper, silver, gold and platinum) picks in the second period against two in the first (palladium and platinum) as well as for the open interest nearby growth factor for which there are three metals (silver, gold and platinum) picks in the second period against one in the first (platinum). The market factor has three metal picks in the second period (palladium, gold and silver) while all the picks in the first period were agricultural or energy commodities.<br />
Over the third period, the average CHP factor shows the same metal picks with the agriculturals replaced by energy commodity; the open interest nearby growth factor still has three metal picks with gold swapped for copper and both the market and term structure factors have one, copper.<br />
The table also shows the proportion of time that these picks were constituents of the corresponding factor. All the picks of the long-short factors (average CHP, open interest nearby growth and term structure factors) were constituents of the corresponding factor for some proportion of time in all of the time periods. In this respect, there is a contrast between the first and second periods with the average CHP and open interest nearby growth factor picks appearing predominantly on the long side of the corresponding factor in the second period, as opposed to both legs in the first. The pattern is particularly strong for the metals and energy commodities respectively, with the exception of copper for the average CHP factor that lives in the short leg a higher proportion of the time over the financialisation period. The pattern is reversed for the term structure factor where the picks appear predominantly on the short leg in the second period, as opposed to both legs in the first with the pattern again strongest for the metals. This behaviour continues over the third period for the average CHP and open interest nearby growth factors and indicates that their picks consistently exhibited low commercial hedging pressure and high front contract open interest growth respectively while indicating that the term structure factor picks showed low roll yield in the first and second period.</p>
<p>In table <a href="tables.html#tab:co-movement-correlations">6</a>, we show the average pairwise returns correlation between each set of picks in each time period. Following on form the earlier observations, this exercise gives an indication of the extent to which attribute co-movement reveals price co-movement, which is particularly relevant for the long-short factors for which the corresponding attribute is not directly related to price co-movement.<br />
In the first period the average picks pairwise correlation for the long-short factors ranges from 7.1% (term structure factor picks) to 12.4% (open interest factor picks) while the market factor picks show the highest figure (23.7%). In the second period the figures for the long-short factors rise sharply; up to 22.9% from 8.1% for the average CHP factor picks, up to 32.4% from 12.4% for the open interest factor picks and up to 23.4% from 7.1% for the term structure factor picks. This increase is stronger than that for the market factor picks in a relative sense and is a consequence of the dramatic increase in average pairwise price correlation amongst the US traded metals which dominate the average CHP factor set of picks and which presence is stronger amongst both the open interest and term structure factor sets of picks over the financialisation period. The higher figures for the open interest factor are driven by the strong presence of the energy complex amongst the corresponding picks. The latter exhibits much higher average pairwise correlations than the other sectors in both periods although lower in the second relative to the first which reinforces the role played by the metals in the sharp increase in average pairwise correlation amongst picks for this factor.<br />
With regards to <strong>CHP</strong> regimes, although not very pronounced, a pattern is noticeable. For the market, open interest and term structure factor picks, average pairwise correlations are stronger over phases of <strong>contango</strong> in the first period and over phases of <strong>backwardation</strong> in the financialisation period, eventually reverting back to being stronger over <strong>contango</strong> phases in the crisis period with the CHP factor sets of picks showing the opposite pattern. Overall, these results suggest an increase in correlation between non-price attributes co-movement and price co-movement over the financialisation period. It is also interesting to note that US traded metals returns were negatively correlated with the rest of US traded commodities in the first period and positively in the second.</p>
<p>To further understand the link between attribute and price co-movement we build all of the factors from every set of factor picks and assess their explanatory performance on these sets of picks over the four periods independently. The results are shown in table <a href="tables.html#tab:co-movement-time-reg-picks-facts-picks">7</a>. The long-short factors for a particular attribute select the top and bottom two of the corresponding picks based on that attribute while the market factor takes an equally weighted combination of the eight corresponding picks. In the absence of price co-movement between the picks, the market factor will achieve an average <span class="math inline">\(R^{2}\)</span> of around 12.5%<a href="references.html#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a>, while there is no non-zero <span class="math inline">\(R^{2}\)</span> lower bound for the corresponding long-short factors.<br />
A high average <span class="math inline">\(R^{2}\)</span> for the market factor is indicative of strong price co-movement. In this respect, the most remarkable change in performance in a relative sense is that of the market factor built from the CHP factor sets of picks with the average <span class="math inline">\(R^{2}\)</span> more than doubling, from 18.6% up to 38.1%. For the long-short factors on the other hand it is indicative of simultaneous attribute and price co-movement. For the factors built from the market factor picks the increase is strongest in a relative sense for the CHP factor with the <span class="math inline">\(R^{2}\)</span> more than doubling, going from 5.6% in the first period up to 12.4% in the second with the increase stronger for the long leg (17.1% vs. 27.9%) relative to the short (16.5% vs. 21.4%). In the case of the factors built from the CHP factor picks, the CHP factor built with its own picks shows a remarkable increase in a relative sense with the <span class="math inline">\(R^{2}\)</span> tripling, from 7.2% to 21.4% and the long leg showing a much greater increase relative to the short (10.4% to 31.1% vs. 8.3% to 9.8%). The performance of the term structure factor built from the CHP factor sets of picks also shows a sizable increase in a relative sense, from 3.5% to 5.3% and even more remarkable in this case is the substantial increase in performance of the short leg, from 6.3% to 15.7% relative to the long (7.5% to 9.8%). The pattern is reversed for the CHP factor built from the term structure factor picks where the average <span class="math inline">\(R^{2}\)</span> increases from 4.7% to 8% with the performance of the long leg increasing from 11.9% to 28.1% vs. 5.5% to 9.1% for the short. The performance of the term structure factor constructed from its own sets of picks also shows a substantial increase, from 5.1% to 8.4% with, here again the increase in performance relatively stronger for the short leg, from 6% to 16.1% vs. 7.6% to 12.1% for the long.<br />
Taken together with the previous results showing that the metal complex predominantly loads on the long and short legs of the original CHP and term structure factors respectively, these results provide evidence of convergence of Keynesian and Working’s theories of the term structure in detecting price co-movement during financialisation perhaps as a result of spillover effects between the corresponding futures and spot markets as suggested in <span class="citation">Basak and Pavlova (2016)</span>.</p>
<p>In table <a href="tables.html#tab:co-movement-time-reg-US-facts-picks">8</a> we assess the performance of the same factors on all the commodities instead of just the picks. While the average <span class="math inline">\(R^{2}\)</span>s are expectedly lower, the pattern of results mostly holds with the relative performance of the market factors built with different sets of picks as well as that of the CHP and term structure factors built with each other’s picks similar to table <a href="tables.html#tab:co-movement-time-reg-picks-facts-picks">7</a>. In contrast, the average CHP factor built with average CHP factor picks shows a smaller absolute increase in average <span class="math inline">\(R^{2}\)</span> indicating that the link between CHP co-movement and price co-movement is stronger amongst the picks which are predominantly metals. Taken together, the results in tables <a href="tables.html#tab:co-movement-time-reg-picks-facts-picks">7</a> and <a href="tables.html#tab:co-movement-time-reg-US-facts-picks">8</a> suggest that the onset of financialisation had a major impact on the dynamics of US traded precious and precious-base metals.<br />
To assess whether this phenomenon extended beyond US borders we examine the performance of the factors used in the last two tables above on the six UK metals futures traded on the London Metal Exchange with the results reported in table <a href="tables.html#tab:co-movement-time-reg-UK-facts-picks">9</a>. In the first period, although all sets of picks, except that of the market factor, included at least one metal, the average <span class="math inline">\(R^{2}\)</span>s are very low; close to zero in most cases. These figures drastically increase across the board in the financialisation period and show a pattern similar to that observed in the US complex. The market factor built from the CHP and term structure factor sets of picks shows the sharpest increase in performance, relative to using the other sets of factor picks; rising to 20.1% from 1.5% and to 15% from 0.8% respectively. The increase in <span class="math inline">\(R^{2}\)</span> for the market factor built with market factor picks is more modest, providing further evidence of concentration of co-movement in the metals sector during financialisation.<br />
Here again the change in performance for the CHP and term structure factor legs stands out where the factors are built with their own as well as each other’s sets of picks. The average <span class="math inline">\(R^{2}\)</span> for the long leg of the CHP factor built with its own sets of picks increases from 1% to 11% while the short leg shows no significant change. The opposite holds for the term structure factor built from its own set of picks with the short leg performance increasing from 0.1% to 14% while that of the long leg remains below 1%. Building these factors from each other’s sets of picks produces a similar pattern with the performance of the long leg of the CHP factor built from the term structure factor picks increasing from 0.7% to 11.4%; a much greater increase relative to the short leg although in this case the latter also shows a sizable increase in performance (0.3% to 6%). The performance of the short leg of the term structure factor built from the CHP factor sets of picks on the other hand increases from 0.3% to 19.2% while the performance for the long leg in the second period remains below 1.5%.<br />
Taken together these results emphasise the global nature of the impact of financialisation on the metals complex and provide further evidence that global metals co-movement could be detected by US based factor models that combine the Keynesian and Working’s term structure paradigms. There seems thus to be information in the factor constructed from hedging pressure based on the Keynesian paradigm relevant to the term structure factor built on the Working paradigm and these findings therefore appear to complement the results of <span class="citation">Kang, Rouwenhorst, and Tang (2020)</span> who find that hedging pressure both conveys information about liquidity provision in the short term (Working paradigm) and risk transfer in the longer term (Keynesian paradigm).</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The crisis period (late 2008 to mid-2013) shows a contrasting pattern of results. Returns fall sharply relative to the financialisation period (table <a href="tables.html#tab:co-movement-stats-no-regimes">1</a>) with eighteen US commodities along with all six UK traded metals showing lower mean returns. Returns for equally weighted portfolios of both sets of assets fall down to 9.4% and 5.3% from 15.9% and 21.8% respectively. Returns are mostly higher during phases of <strong>backwardation</strong> relative to <strong>contango</strong> (table <a href="tables.html#tab:co-movement-stats-regimes">2</a>) with fifteen US assets and five of the UK traded metals showing higher mean returns in <strong>backwardation</strong> and the pattern extending to equally weighted portfolios of the two sets of assets. Volatility is moderately higher for both sets with fifteen US commodities and three UK metals showing higher figures and interestingly eminently higher over phases of <strong>contango</strong>; out of the US complex only Sugar-#11 (IFUS) and none of the UK traded metals show higher volatility figures over <strong>backwardation</strong> phases. The symmetry between the dynamics of CHP and <strong>CHP</strong>’s explanatory power on individual commodity returns breaks in the crisis period with both now seemingly converging; the US cross-sectional average <span class="math inline">\(R^{2}\)</span> at the individual level bouncing back up (22.5% vs 20.8%) while that at the aggregate level rises further (14.7% vs 7.1%).<br />
The performance of the market factor dominates the US commodity complex over the period with a 50% increase in mean average <span class="math inline">\(R^{2}\)</span> to over 30% (table <a href="tables.html#tab:co-movement-time-reg-US-facts-US">4</a>) while that of the CHP factor decreases and, although increasing, remains modest for the open interest growth and term structure factors. The average pairwise correlation amongst the market factor picks increases beyond 50% while there is a leveling in that amongst the picks of the long-short factors as shown in table <a href="tables.html#tab:co-movement-correlations">6</a>. Notwithstanding, the market factor built from any sets of picks shows a significant rise across the board in performance on the US complex (table <a href="tables.html#tab:co-movement-time-reg-US-facts-picks">8</a>).<br />
Taken together, these results indicate the presence of a systematic factor across the entire cross-section of the US commodities. Table <a href="tables.html#tab:co-movement-time-reg-UK-facts-picks">9</a> provides further evidence of systematic linkages, in this case between US and non-US traded commodities with a similar, albeit more pronounced pattern, where the market factor constructed with any sets of picks (US traded commodities) shows a dramatic increase in performance on the UK metals with for example, when constructed from its own sets of picks, the average <span class="math inline">\(R^{2}\)</span> increasing to 31.7% from 10.2% in the previous period.</p>
<p>The returns pullback continues into the post-crisis period (table <a href="tables.html#tab:co-movement-stats-no-regimes">1</a>) with twenty-two US and four UK traded assets showing lower mean returns relative to the crisis while the same number of US commodities and all UK metals show lower figures relative to the financialisation period; mean returns for equally weighted portfolios of US and UK assets drop down to -0.2% and 2.7% respectively. Interestingly volatility also recedes substantially with twenty US assets and all UK metals showing lower volatility figures relative to both the crisis and financialisation periods suggesting that investment outflows from the commodity futures complex have had a lower impact on volatility than the corresponding inflows witnessed over the financialisation period. The figures for the equally weighted portfolios of US and UK assets drop to 9.9% and 16.2% respectively, very close to pre-financialisation levels.<br />
The pattern of reversion toward the pre-financialisation Keynesian paradigm initiated during the crisis continues stronger into the post-crisis period (table <a href="tables.html#tab:co-movement-stats-regimes">2</a>) with mean returns higher during phases of <strong>backwardation</strong> relative to <strong>contango</strong> (table <a href="tables.html#tab:co-movement-stats-regimes">2</a>), more so than over the crisis period with seventeen US commodities showing higher mean returns over <strong>backwardation</strong> phases. The difference is significant at the 5% level for Lumber (XCME) and at the 10% level for Palladium (XNYM) while no difference is significant for the assets showing higher figures over phases of <strong>contango</strong>. The pattern is more pronounced for the UK traded subset with all six assets showing higher mean returns in <strong>backwardation</strong> with the difference significant at the 1% level for Nickel-primary (XLME), 5% level for Aluminium (XLME) and 10% level for Zinc (XLME). It also extends to equally weighted portfolios of US and UK traded assets that both show higher mean returns during <strong>backwardation</strong> with the difference significant at the 5% level for the UK portfolio and the figure close to the 10% level significance threshold for the portfolio of US assets. Volatilities are overall higher in <strong>contango</strong> although less so than over the previous period with seventeen US commodities showing higher figures over <strong>contango</strong> against twenty-three in the crisis period. The pattern extends to three of the six UK traded metals with the difference significant at the 1% level for Copper (XLME) and Tin (XLME) and at the 5% level for Zinc (XLME) while differences are not significant for Aluminium (XLME), Lead (XLME) and Nickel-primary (XLME) that exhibit higher volatility over <strong>backwardation</strong> phases. Equally weighted portfolios of US and UK traded assets on the other hand both show higher volatility in <strong>contango</strong> with the difference significant at the 1% level for both. Over the financialisation period in contrast volatilities were predominantly higher in <strong>backwardation</strong> for US traded assets with fourteen commodities showing higher volatility figures in these phases; the post-crisis pattern of results for volatilities thus likewise shows signs of reversion to pre-financialisation standards. After showing signs of convergence in the crisis period the dynamics of the explanatory power of CHP and <strong>CHP</strong> part ways (table <a href="tables.html#tab:co-movement-time-reg-US-CHP">3</a>), seemingly reverting to the Keynesian paradigm observed pre-financialisation, further suggesting a return to legacy commodity specific dynamics. The recovery initiated in the crisis period for that of CHP is confirmed with a stronger increase in the post-crisis period, 27.2% vs. 22.5%, strongest for the metals sector, 37.3% vs. 23.7%, while the energy sector shows the opposite pattern: 11% vs. 16%. In contrast, after increasing stronger in the crisis, that for <strong>CHP</strong> falls overall in the post-crisis period, 7.5% vs 14.7%, with the decrease strongest for the energy sector in a relative sense: 2.5% vs. 14.8%.<br />
Average pairwise correlations amongst factor picks (table <a href="tables.html#tab:co-movement-correlations">6</a>) fall substantially in the post-crisis period with for example the figure for the market factor picks dropping from 50.1% to 26.1%, almost down to pre-financialisation levels; results are similar for the long-short factor picks with figures below financialisation levels in all cases and very close to pre-financialisation standards for the term structure and liquidity factor picks. The performance of the market factor on the US complex declines below financialisation levels (table <a href="tables.html#tab:co-movement-time-reg-US-facts-US">4</a>) with the pattern similar albeit stronger when the factor is built from the sets of factor picks with a decline in performance on the US complex (table <a href="tables.html#tab:co-movement-time-reg-US-facts-picks">8</a>) to almost pre-financialisation levels when constructed with its own set of picks as well as with those of the long-short factors, in particular the term structure and liquidity factors. Table <a href="tables.html#tab:co-movement-time-reg-UK-facts-picks">9</a> provides further evidence of decoupling, in this case between US and non-US traded commodities with a sharp decline in performance of the market factor constructed with any set of picks on the UK complex below financialisation, down to almost pre-financialisation levels when constructed with the sets of long-short factors picks.</p>
<p>Taken together the patterns of results over the crisis and post-crisis periods echo those in <span class="citation">Basu and Bauthéac (2021)</span> in suggesting that the exogenous shock delivered by the financial crisis combined with the accommodative monetary policy that ensued seem to have initiated a reversion toward pre-financialisation fundamentals in the commodity futures complex.</p>
